While this\nsetting is enabled, all search engine optimisation features will be switched off\nto help keep your site under the radar.\n\nDo remember though, this is not  secure authentication. You shouldn't rely on\nthis feature for protecting important private data. It's just a simple, shared\npass-phrase for some very basic privacy.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInvite your team \nGhost has a number of different user roles for your team:\n\nContributors\nThis is the base user level in Ghost. Contributors can create and edit their own\ndraft posts, but they are unable to edit drafts of others or publish posts.\nContributors are untrusted  users with the most basic access to your\npublication.\n\nAuthors\nAuthors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit  and publish\ntheir own posts. Authors are trusted  users. If you don't trust users to be\nallowed to publish their own posts, they should be set as Contributors.\n\nEditors\nEditors are the 3rd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an\nAuthor can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well\nas their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors+Authors to the site.\n\nAdministrators\nThe top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do\neverything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site\nsettings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full\naccess to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.\n\nThe Owner\nThere is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which\nhas all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The\nOwner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access\nto additional special settings if applicable. For example: billing details, if\nusing Ghost(Pro) [https://ghost.org/pricing/].\n\n> It's a good idea to ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles,\nincluding bio and social links. These will populate rich structured data for\nposts and generally create more opportunities for themes to fully populate their\ndesign.\nNext up: Organising your content [/organising-content/]","feature_image":"https://static.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/admin-settings.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2019-04-06T00:53:15.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2019-04-06T00:53:15.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2019-04-06T00:53:18.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"There are a couple of things to do next while you're getting set up: making your site private and inviting your team.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca7f87b25d25c10b75d159d","uuid":"4029d5dd-08fd-4019-91cd-763e8941dc49","title":"Publishing options","slug":"publishing-options","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"code\",{\"code\":\"{\\n    \\\"@context\\\": \\\"https://schema.org\\\",\\n    \\\"@type\\\": \\\"Article\\\",\\n    \\\"publisher\\\": {\\n        \\\"@type\\\": \\\"Organization\\\",\\n        \\\"name\\\": \\\"Publishing options\\\",\\n        \\\"logo\\\": \\\"https://static.ghost.org/ghost-logo.svg\\\"\\n    },\\n    \\\"author\\\": {\\n        \\\"@type\\\": \\\"Person\\\",\\n        \\\"name\\\": \\\"Ghost\\\",\\n        \\\"url\\\": \\\"http://demo.ghost.io/author/ghost/\\\",\\n        \\\"sameAs\\\": []\\n    },\\n    \\\"headline\\\": \\\"Publishing options\\\",\\n    \\\"url\\\": \\\"http://demo.ghost.io/publishing-options\\\",\\n    \\\"datePublished\\\": \\\"2018-08-08T11:44:00.000Z\\\",\\n    \\\"dateModified\\\": \\\"2018-08-09T12:06:21.000Z\\\",\\n    \\\"keywords\\\": \\\"Getting Started\\\",\\n    \\\"description\\\": \\\"The Ghost editor has everything you need to fully optimise your content.

Ghost is not\n    necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple\n    personal blog. \n 3. For the best experience we recommend downloading the Ghost Desktop App\n    [https://ghost.org/downloads/]  for your computer, which is the best way to\n    access your Ghost site on a desktop device. \n\nGhost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost\nFoundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our Ghost(Pro)\n[https://ghost.org/pricing]  service, and every penny we make is re-invested\ninto funding further development of free, open source technology for modern\npublishing.\n\nThe version of Ghost you are looking at right now would not have been made\npossible without generous contributions from the open source community\n[https://github.com/TryGhost].\n\nNext up, the editor\nThe main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: the Ghost editor\n[/the-editor/]. This is where the good stuff happens.\n\n> By the way, once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default Ghost \nuser from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!","feature_image":"https://static.ghost.org/v2.0.0/images/welcome-to-ghost.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"5951f5fca366002ebd5dbef7","created_at":"2019-04-06T00:53:15.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2019-04-06T00:53:15.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2019-04-06T00:53:21.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"Welcome, it's great to have you here.\nWe know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial getting started posts that will help you get familiar with everything in no time.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc775","uuid":"806d6da1-da9a-41c6-a339-1526a50fbdfa","title":"About","slug":"about","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Greetings!\\n\\nMy name is Joseph Dissmeyer.\\n\\nFollow me on twitter, https://twitter.com/joedissmeyer.

It has been quite a bit of time since I last wrote a post here. In my defense I have been insanely busy with family, work, and especially with planning my next SolarWinds NPM book. So on that note, let’s get straight to today’s topic – install GNS3 v1.4 on Windows 10. \\n\\n### What is GNS3?\\n\\nGNS stands for “graphical network simulator 3”. It is emulation software that can run real-time Cisco IOS, JunOS, and other network OSes in a virtual environment (think virtual machines for network OSes such as Cisco’s IOS routers). GNS3 is very popular for those that create proof-of-concept networks for their own enterprise environments but it is also very popular for those training for the coveted Cisco certifications. It is important because GNS3 can be used in place of real hardware. As of the time of this writing the current GNS3 release is v1.4.0. \\n\\nI am personally using GNS3 to help me with my next SolarWinds book. Plus it is just fun learning how to set up networks in a virtual environment. So lets get started! \\n_This guide assumes you have at least an intermediate knowledge of networking and server administration._\\n\\n### Requirements:\\n\\n1. A Windows 10 Pro PC with at least 8GB RAM and Quad-core CPU. \\n\\n** At the time of writing this post I’m using Windows 10 Pro build 10586.63 with 16GB RAM. (These instructions have not been tested on Windows 10 Home editions but it should work.)\\n2. [VMware Workstation 12 Pro](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation)\\n\\nAssuming you have VMware Workstation 12 Pro installed on your Windows 10 Pro PC, we can get started! Lets download the software we need: \\n\\n* GNS3 v1.4.0\\n* GNS3 Virtual Machine OVA Image for VMware\\n* Cisco 3660 IOS image\\n\\n### Download the GNS3 software\\n\\nNavigate to and log in (sign up for an account if you don’t have one). On the downloads page, note the links in the screenshot below. You need the Windows download as well as the GNS3 VM. Get both of them and save the files locally. \\n\\n### Get a supported Cisco IOS image\\n\\nCisco IOS images are downloaded from Cisco.com provided you are legally licensed for the software. Luckily I am legally licensed. For this example I am using the image c3660-jk9o3s-mz.124-25d.bin. \\n\\n### Import the GNS3 VM OVA into VMware Workstation\\n\\nBefore we GNS3 we need to import the VM image into VMware Workstation so it is ready to go. \\n\\n1. Launch VMware Workstation.\\n2. Click File > Open[![image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0Fk7-S5Q_yA/Vp8ZKJrt73I/AAAAAAAAIX4/XOn7PjrEsx0/image_thumb%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5kIYuU-OHZY/Vp8ZJghzdCI/AAAAAAAAIXw/Xadokm6GaQI/s1600-h/image%25255B7%25255D.png)\\n3. Locate and select the GNS3 VM.OVA file, click Open.\\n4. The Import Virtual Machine window will appear. Select the storage path and name for the VM (I’m using the default options). Click **Import** to finish.[![image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-O-6P2MV7iYc/Vp8ZKkvGpHI/AAAAAAAAIYI/s1cXxcxXvPM/image_thumb%25255B5%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cL8tyrVQ9Co/Vp8ZKX7AjPI/AAAAAAAAIYA/jlYGlflilGc/s1600-h/image%25255B16%25255D.png)\\n\\nThe VM should now be imported and available. Leave VMW12 running (don’t close it) because GNS3 will automatically access the VM on-demand. We can now proceed with installing and configuring GNS3 on our PC. \\n\\n### Installing GNS3\\n\\nNow that we have all of the prerequisite items, we can move forward with the installation. \\n\\n1.

Locate and select the GNS3 VM.OVA file, click Open.\n 4. The Import Virtual Machine window will appear. Select the storage path and\n    name for the VM (I’m using the default options). Click Import  to finish. \n    [https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cL8tyrVQ9Co/Vp8ZKX7AjPI/AAAAAAAAIYA/jlYGlflilGc/s1600-h/image%25255B16%25255D.png]\n\nThe VM should now be imported and available. Leave VMW12 running (don’t close\nit) because GNS3 will automatically access the VM on-demand. We can now proceed\nwith installing and configuring GNS3 on our PC.\n\nInstalling GNS3\nNow that we have all of the prerequisite items, we can move forward with the\ninstallation.\n\n 1.  Launch the installer, click Next.\n 2.  Agree to the license terms, click I Agree.\n 3.  At Choose Start Menu Folder, click Next.\n 4.  At Choose Components, select ALL items  and click Next.\n 5.  At Choose Install Location, define a location and click Install. **Default\n     C:\\Program Files\\ is recommended.\n 6.  The WinPcap installer will appear. Click Next\n 7.  Click I Agree  on the license terms.\n 8.  Make sure the check mark is selected to automatically start the driver at\n     boot time. Click Install, then Finish\n 9.  The Wireshark installer will appear. Click Next, then click I Agree.\n 10. Select all components then click Next.\n 11. On Additional Tasks, click Next.\n 12. On Choose Install Location, leave the default location and click Next.\n 13. Remove the checkmark  to install WinPcap (because we already installed it).\n     Click Install.\n 14. When Wireshark is installed, click Next  then Finish.\n 15. The SolarWinds Response Time Viewer installer will appear. Enter your email\n     address then click Continue.\n 16. Click Next,\n 17. Accept the license terms, Click Next,\n 18. At Choose Install Location, leave the default path then click Next, then \n     Next  again.\n 19. Click Finish.\n 20. The GNS3 software will finish installing on it’s own. Click Next  when\n     done.\n 21. The “SolarWinds Standard Toolset” free license option appeared for me. I\n     opted out of the free offer. I leave it up to you if you want it.\n 22. Go ahead and click Finish to launch GNS3 for the first time.\n\nLets move forward with initial setup.\n\nConfiguring GNS3\n 1. The Setup Wizard will appear. Since we are using the GNS3 VM in VMware,\n    choose the Local GNS3 VM option then click Next. \n    [https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4BmyBF4BnnM/Vp8ZLCUpAhI/AAAAAAAAIYQ/c11qP0u8VOs/s1600-h/image%25255B4%25255D.png]\n 2. Select VMware and the VM we imported. I recommend changing the vCPU cores to\n    2x and reducing the RAM to 2048 for now. Click Next  to proceed.\n\nNOTE: You can always increase the vCPU cores to 4x and increase the RAM at a\nlater time if you plan on having a larger virtual environment. My personal\nconfiguration is shown in the screenshot below. \n[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--eqCMNgHtQ4/Vp8ZL2I0gkI/AAAAAAAAIYk/l_kGhyq8wBE/s1600-h/image%25255B20%25255D.png]\n3. GNS3 will automatically start up the virtual machine in VMware. At Add\nVirtual Machines, check the box “Add an IOS router using a real IOS image” then\nclick Finish. \n[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iM-Ed9khBKc/Vp8ZM8eV1EI/AAAAAAAAIYw/PuYfY_6VmQg/s1600-h/image%25255B24%25255D.png]\n4. Choose the GNS3 VM server type and click Next. \n[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NeifmJt8grY/Vp8ZN0wRZPI/AAAAAAAAIZE/KXu8KuRk8eI/s1600-h/image%25255B32%25255D.png]\n5.

At Name and Platform, choose the appropriate options for your image and click\n Next.\n\nNOTE: The default options will suffice for most. When in doubt just use the\ndefault options. \n[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MPyIrWQ_Mgg/Vp8ZPgYyEMI/AAAAAAAAIZg/F63UNJGJmgw/s1600-h/image%25255B46%25255D.png]\n7. Select the default RAM and click Next.\n\nAgain, when in doubt just use the default option. \n[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-IIj5XXPsMK4/Vp8ZQZrtLNI/AAAAAAAAIZw/TJjzZ6YNjKs/s1600-h/image%25255B47%25255D.png]\n8. The next screen is where you define the default adapters that are added\nautomatically when a new copy of this device is added to the GNS3 lab\nenvironment. Choose the adapters you want then click Next. \n[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RGy1wSchSUA/Vp8ZRBJNC5I/AAAAAAAAIaA/6pY8gxYniME/s1600-h/image%25255B48%25255D.png]\n9. At the idle-pc finder, skip this section and just click Finish. (This can be\ndone at a later time.)\n10. The Preferences window will appear. Just click OK  to close.\n11. Create a new Lab name then click OK. \n[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4EyK9rvAtmg/Vp8ZSP-4n5I/AAAAAAAAIaQ/cjdVlvG8jGA/s1600-h/image%25255B52%25255D.png]\n\nAnd that is it! GNS3 is now installed and working in VMware Workstation. If you\nopen up VMware you should see the GNS3 virtual machine running and should look\nsimilar to the screenshot below.\n\nAdding Your First Device to the Lab\nEverything is now good to go. So lets go ahead and add in the first device and\nget it up and running!\nClick the devices button, drag and drop the device into the lab pane, then click\nthe Play button.\n[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9xe72aAdBaY/Vp8ZT5JSk6I/AAAAAAAAIaw/kRs5iegKQQw/s1600-h/image%25255B61%25255D.png]\nIf everything is good, you’ll see the device status in green on the topology\npane. Right-click the device and choose Console to open up the PuTTY console\nwindow to confirm.\n\nFrom this point you should head over to the GNS3 community and start learning!\nHere is a direct link: .\n\nThere are also a bunch of additional how-to/example videos on YouTube for GNS3\nso you’ll want to look there as well.\n\nA few notes:\n\n * Don’t close VMware Workstation when you have GNS3 open because it will shut\n   down your virtual machines and cause GNS3 to crash.\n * Don’t close GNS3 until you have saved your lab because GNS3 will\n   automatically shut down the GNS3 VM in VMware Workstation when the app is\n   closed. Also when you launch GNS3 it will automatically launch VMware\n   Workstation and start up the VM. This is by design and is helpful so you\n   won’t have to remember to start/stop the VM when launching or closing GNS3.\n\nWell, that’s all I have for now. I’m still working on setting up my GNS3 and\nSolarWinds lab environments so maybe I’ll have more to write about soon. Have\nfun setting up your own labs!\n\nhttps://gns3.com/community","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1451187580459-43490279c0fa?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&s=90369b1af3c31e8d54930b1eab8adc35","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2016-01-20T10:20:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2017-10-20T02:46:06.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2016-01-20T10:20:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc77e","uuid":"80a35716-2539-4b2f-8fbf-02131f3d3cd8","title":"How to Set the Execution Policy in Powershell 5.0","slug":"how_to_set_the_execution_policy_in_powershell_5_0","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I ran into a problem in Windows 10 (build 10130) where I couldn't set the Powershell execution policy to \\\"unrestricted\\\".

Believe it or not I knew nothing about the \\\"CryptoLocker\\\" ransomware because I've been working on backend support instead of desktop support over the past year. Also, I didn't know about some of the new accessibility features for the visual or hearing impaired in mobile devices (which is very very cool stuff!). I am very excited for our next SpiceCorp meetup because I know I will learn something new yet again. \\nIn my opinion, attending these IT Pro meetups have been one of the best things I've done for my career. I'm people networking with other IT Pros, I'm learning new things that I probably wouldn't have learned on my own, and it's just a fun time sharing war stories and ideas and projects. I think that attending meetups is the key to increasing and sharing knowledge. Attending IT Pro or Developer meetups can be extremely rewarding so I highly encourage that you find a group for yourself. \\n\\nIf you want to start up or attend a meetup group, here are some of my own tips: \\n\\n* Be consistent. – As an organizer this is something I learned the hard way. Having a regular meetup is a commitment. As an organizer, if you want people to come or if you want to maintain the group's existence and attendance it is important to be consistent. If you have a meetup every month make sure you schedule it and keep the date every month. If you meet at a regular place, don't suddenly change the venue without discussing the change with the group first. As an attendee, once you find a meetup group you like plan on attending as often as you can because it not only helps the group's comfort level increase with regards to discussion, but it also helps you get more comfortable in discussing topics. There is tremendous value here…\\n* Communicate Changes as Early as Possible – As an organizer make sure you give plenty of notice for when changes occur (such as venue locations or the meetup schedule). Everyone has time commitments so giving ample notice allows group members to plan on if they can attend or not. This is courtesy and is common sense. The same situation applies for attendees such as if you RSVP'ed but need to back out. Make sure you give notice of changes if you can't attend as a courtesy to the organizer(s).\\n* Plan on Joining the Conversation – Organizers should promote an open minded discussion on whatever technology topic your group members want to discuss. For example, in my last meetup I wasn't planning on talking about accessibility features but it led to a very vibrant and positive conversation. Even talking about mobile might not sound interesting but you'd be surprised what you might not have known about a topic you thought you were an expert in.\\n* Treat your meetup as a social learning event – IT Pro meetups exist not to hoard knowledge. They exist to share knowledge! If you host a meetup or attend one, plan on sharing something.\\n* Give away free swag every once in a while (if you can). – Being an IT Pro usually gets us access to cool stuff from vendors. Polo shirts or t-shirts, gift cards, coffee mugs, pens, mouse pads, free software licenses, and more are all at our fingertips. Giving away free stuff is usually an incentive for people to come. But the point of the meetup is not to try and draw in a bunch of people just to get attendance increased. Free swag should only be a bonus of attending the meetup and shouldn't be the reason why the meetup exists. Only give away swag every once in a while if you can help it.\\n\\nWell, there are many more but these are just a few of my own tips for meeting organizers and attendees. I hope you have\\\\find your own IT Pro meetup.

I am very excited for our next SpiceCorp meetup because I know I will learn something new yet again.<br>\nIn my opinion, attending these IT Pro meetups have been one of the best things I've done for my career.

I think that attending meetups is the key to increasing and sharing knowledge. Attending IT Pro or Developer meetups can be extremely rewarding so I highly encourage that you find a group for yourself.</p>\n<p>If you want to start up or attend a meetup group, here are some of my own tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be consistent. – As an organizer this is something I learned the hard way. Having a regular meetup is a commitment. As an organizer, if you want people to come or if you want to maintain the group's existence and attendance it is important to be consistent. If you have a meetup every month make sure you schedule it and keep the date every month. If you meet at a regular place, don't suddenly change the venue without discussing the change with the group first. As an attendee, once you find a meetup group you like plan on attending as often as you can because it not only helps the group's comfort level increase with regards to discussion, but it also helps you get more comfortable in discussing topics. There is tremendous value here…</li>\n<li>Communicate Changes as Early as Possible – As an organizer make sure you give plenty of notice for when changes occur (such as venue locations or the meetup schedule). Everyone has time commitments so giving ample notice allows group members to plan on if they can attend or not. This is courtesy and is common sense. The same situation applies for attendees such as if you RSVP'ed but need to back out. Make sure you give notice of changes if you can't attend as a courtesy to the organizer(s).</li>\n<li>Plan on Joining the Conversation – Organizers should promote an open minded discussion on whatever technology topic your group members want to discuss. For example, in my last meetup I wasn't planning on talking about accessibility features but it led to a very vibrant and positive conversation. Even talking about mobile might not sound interesting but you'd be surprised what you might not have known about a topic you thought you were an expert in.</li>\n<li>Treat your meetup as a social learning event – IT Pro meetups exist not to hoard knowledge. They exist to share knowledge! If you host a meetup or attend one, plan on sharing something.</li>\n<li>Give away free swag every once in a while (if you can). – Being an IT Pro usually gets us access to cool stuff from vendors. Polo shirts or t-shirts, gift cards, coffee mugs, pens, mouse pads, free software licenses, and more are all at our fingertips. Giving away free stuff is usually an incentive for people to come. But the point of the meetup is not to try and draw in a bunch of people just to get attendance increased. Free swag should only be a bonus of attending the meetup and shouldn't be the reason why the meetup exists. Only give away swag every once in a while if you can help it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well, there are many more but these are just a few of my own tips for meeting organizers and attendees. I hope you have\\find your own IT Pro meetup.

And rumor has it that Google will be releasing Android L in a few short months. So as you can see there has been quite a bit of talk about mobile. And with all of this talk, I’ve had mobile phone fever. It was time for me to select my next daily driver.\\n\\n## Why upgrade?\\n\\nFor the past year my daily driver has been the iPhone 4s.\\n\\n![](https://www.apple.com/lae/iphone-4s/specs/images/product_controls.jpg)\\n\\nThe reason why I’ve been using it is because my job provided me with it for work purposes. Over the past 14 months it more or less has gotten the job done. I’ve been able to respond to work emails, use the tethering here and there, and use Facetime when needed. However my 4s has been performing poorly much more often than normal. So naturally I’ve been wanting to upgrade to something else. For the curious, here is a list of the problems that I’ve been having with my 4s:\\n\\n* The external speaker has been cutting out at random times. When the phone rings, I only catch the calls half the time because the speaker never rings the call. I can’t narrow this down when or how the problem occurs, but it started after I upgraded the phone to iOS 7\\\\. I never had this problem when it was running iOS 6\\\\. I’ve read this is a common problem with the 4s…\\n* Phone performance has degraded quite a bit over the past year. There are various performance issues with my 4s where apps sometimes fail to open and I need to force close the app and try again. For example, the “Phone app” displays a grey screen instead of displaying the dialer sometimes. Yes, I do subscribe to podcasts and stream music daily. So I believe most of my performance problems is likely has to do with flash memory performance over time. The only solution for this is to get a newer device. For those that don’t know about why flash memory performance breaks down over time, I suggest you read this article.\\n* The small screen size doesn’t help. Sure I’ve been dealing with the 3.5 inch screen since last year and I’ve put up with it. But reading articles or reading emails on that tiny screen is really annoying. It is time to get something bigger.\\n* Battery life has severely degraded over the past year as well. When I first got the phone, a full charge in the morning allows me to use the 4s throughout the entire work day. This includes listening to a full hour of music or podcasts in the morning, making and taking iMessages and up to 5 phone calls (at 10 minutes per call) during the day, another hour of podcasting on my way home, and light usage until 8pm at night. I used to still have 30% battery life left at the end of the day. Nowadays my 4s would be dead before I leave the office to drive home --- and no, I don’t have Facebook installed on it and I don’t use GPS often.\\n\\nSo I’ve pretty much had enough with the iPhone 4s. It is time for me to upgrade! But to what device, and why?\\n\\n## My Requirements\\n\\nI came up with several requirements and my friends helped me write them down:\\n\\n1. Large bright screen\\n2. Video chat support for Facetime or Skype\\n3. Long battery life\\n4. Cisco AnyConnect in App Store\\n5. Great camera with flash\\n6. Chromecast support\\n\\nRight off the bat, I was a bit disappointed. Because of my requirements above I couldn’t choose a Windows Phone. I’ve heard of many people that love their Windows Phones, and I’ve heard of many people that hate them too. But I want to try a Windows Phone anyways and see how it goes for me. But without Chromecast supported apps or Cisco AnyConnect VPN I just can’t choose a Windows Phone – not right now. I’m a Verizon customer, so is most of my family and a large number of my colleagues. So I knew I was going to stick with Verizon again when I upgraded.\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\nI walked into the Verizon store and looked at all of the devices available. First was the Samsung wall. I looked at the Galaxy Note 3 first.\\n\\n![](http://www.3g.co.uk/g_phones/large/samsung-galaxy-note-3-review-2.jpg)\\n\\nIt was in it’s folio case so I got to check out the entire feature set. The screen was nice and bright and it was very responsive. The phone is huge! But after playing around with it for a few minutes, for me it was just too big. Now I am a big guy myself – I’m 6’5 and 300 pounds, and I have huge hands too (I can easily palm an NBA regulation sized basketball). But the device just didn’t feel right in one hand. The more I evaluated the Note 3 I came to the conclusion that I would be forced to use it most of the time with 2 hands. I did like the Note 3 but I kept eyeing the phone next to it – the Galaxy S4\\\\.\\n\\n![](http://cdn.thedroidguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S4.jpg?617318)\\n\\nSo I picked up the S4 and played around with it too. The S4 does have a very nice screen. But the device just didn’t feel right in my hands for some reason. The build quality was a bit questionable for my tastes, too ‘plasticy’. My wife has an S4 and she loves it but I’m picky. A Galaxy S5 was right next to the S4 so I checked that out too.\\n\\n![](http://www.t-mobile.com/content/dam/tmo/en-g/hotspot/rockford_hotspotflat_1240x700_mainimage.png)\\n\\nI liked the screen and the look and feel of the S5 much more than the S4\\\\. The S5 was light in the hand, was very responsive, and felt more durable than the S4\\\\. Also the back cover of the phone was less prone to slipping out of the hand than the S4\\\\. A colleague of mine has the Galaxy S5 Active on AT&T and he swears by it. He showed me a 1080p recording on it too, which was fantastic! I kept on playing around with the S5 and opened apps, called my phone to check the call quality, and took a few pics on the device just to see what it was like. My only gripe was that the Samsung devices still use TouchWiz UI which I do not like, but I could deal with it if needed. At this point the S5 was at the top of my list but I needed to check out the rest of the phones. I wanted to make sure I was making the right choice for me.\\n\\nRight next to the Galaxy devices was the HTC One M8 Windows edition.\\n\\n![](http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/htc-one-m8.jpg)\\n\\nMan, that is a really really nice phone! It is metal, has two speakers on the front, and the screen was awesome. Then next to that was the Nokia Lumia Icon Windows phone.\\n\\n![](http://cmsresources.windowsphone.com/windowsphone/en-US/cmpn/Nokia-Lumia-Icon/carousel/hero-state5.png)\\n\\nI must say that trying to pick out either the HTC or the Lumia was like Sophie’s choice. It is really hard to pick the one over the other. But if I had to pick one, I’d choose the Lumia Icon. I just liked the Lumia Icon more than the HTC. But I was forced to pass them up because of my requirements. Sorry, maybe in a few months there will be Cisco AnyConnect support in Windows Phone…\\n\\nNext up was the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.\\n\\n![](http://images.bwbx.io/cms/2014-09-10/0910_iphone_swap_970-630x420.jpg)\\n\\nI picked up the iPhone 6 first just to feel it in the hands and it did look and felt great. It was light, much lighter than my 4s to my surprise. It was responsive when swiping the screens, launching apps, and it took great pictures. The screen resolution and brightness was also fantastic. The whole device feels really good. I was also happy to see the iPhone 6 screen size. It seems like Apple finally got the right screen size for their phones in the iPhone 6\\\\. Right next to it was the iPhone 6 Plus. Just like the iPhone 6 it also felt great in the hand, but I put it down after 30 seconds. I just knew that I wasn’t going to select that phone. I had the same assessment of the 6 Plus that I did with the Galaxy Note 3\\\\. See, I’m not an iPhone fanboy or an Android fanboy. I just like to use what works for me. The iPhone 4s has been working for me just fine for quite some time so I knew that if I selected the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus that would work fine for me too. But I wanted to keep looking…\\n\\nThen I stumbled upon the Motorola Droid wall and checked out the Moto X but it was the previous model. I also looked at the Droid MAXX, but I know that phone won’t be getting the Android L release. So long story short I passed up all of the Motorola devices.\\n\\nFinally, the LG wall. I haven’t used an LG phone for at least 4 years now. The last LG phone I had was the enV2\\\\. Remember those “text messaging” specialty phones? Yeah, the enV2 was one of them. The first LG phone I checked out was the LG G Vista.\\n\\n![](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/c380429e4f8ee27ae68024a319ee7f86/200510137/lg-g-vista-verizon-2014-07-31-01.jpg)\\n\\nThe screenshot above really doesn’t do the device justice. With a 5.7 inch screen size it is a HUGE device! Even larger than the Note 3\\\\. But it is pretty much a budget phablet with mid-range internals. I did like it at first, but then I did the screen readability test and it failed. ----- Here is one way to test screen resolution on a phone: Open the browser and navigate to news.ycombinator.com. Can you easily read the tiny text on the screen? If you notice pixelation then the screen resolution isn’t that high and you might want to pass. If you can read every single word without squinting then you’ve got a winner! ----- the G Vista was also a bit sluggish when opening apps and swiping from screen to screen. And the device was just too large for me (even the Note 3 was too large for me). But it was still a nice phone. Next to that was the LG G2\\\\.\\n\\n![](http://cdn3.pcadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/reviews/3471896/LG_G2.JPG)\\n\\nThe G2 is smaller in size than the G Vista, but is larger than the Samsung Galaxy S4\\\\. I love how the G2 felt in the hand and it was a little heavier than others but it still felt great and performed great. The back button placement was a bit strange to me but an interesting feature nonetheless.\\n\\nBut then next to that was the LG G3.\\n\\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BoqRouwCIAEjeZL.png)\\n\\nThis device has a 5.5 inch double 1080p screen and is wider than the Apple or Samsung phones, which I liked. I don’t really like the “tall” screens in the iPhones or the Note devices. I do prefer the wider screen. When I performed the screen readability test, the G3 passed it with flying colors as well. The back buttons on the G3 felt a lot better than the ones on the G2\\\\. I loaded up Beach Buggy Blitz (a great game to test out gaming performance on a mobile device) to get a feel for what type of gaming experience I could get on the phone too. I just kept falling in love with this device the longer I played with it. The camera was very responsive too.\\n\\n### The Moment of Truth: Why the LG G3?\\n\\nI went back to all of the phones I checked out before. It was a toss up between the iPhone 6 (not the 6 Plus) and the LG G3\\\\. If I selected the iPhone 6 I had a lot of benefits including:\\n\\n* Easier migration from my iPhone 4s\\n* I’m already familiar in how to work with iOS\\n* Met all of my current requirements\\n* Will have at least 3 years of software updates (seems to be the current support lifecycle for iOS)\\n\\nBut I still had a lot of reasons to NOT select the iPhone 6\\\\. I’ll give you three for now. First, I really REALLY don’t like the price. Maybe I’m too frugal but I think that paying $649 for a 16GB iPhone is WAY too much. Also, would it really kill Apple to increase the default storage to 32GB? Memory is incredibly cheap nowadays and 16GB just doesn’t cut it anymore. My second reason is that I don’t like being tied to a single ecosystem. iOS is locked down and a less ‘open’ system. Personally I don’t like that. And my third reason is iOS. I am just not a fan of iOS. The design from iOS6 to iOS7 was interesting, but it just doesn’t work for me. Also, since going to iOS7 my phone’s stability has drastically decreased (as explained above). So who’s to say that iOS 8 would be any better?\\n\\nAfter going back to each phone I kept on coming back to the LG G3\\\\. I just loved that phone. For me, it was about the things below:\\n\\n* Software: Even though it had some UI overlays, it felt pretty close to the stock Android OS which I loved. I knew that I could disable any apps or services I didn’t like (like NFL Mobile) and install a different keyboard, amongst other changes. Android is a more ‘open’ system as well so things can be changed to my liking. And with the large amount of apps in the Google Play store I could find any app to help me get most any job done.\\n* Screen size: I don’t like the “tall” iPhone screens. The G3 was a bit wider which I liked. The device isn’t quite a phablet, which is a good thing.\\n* Device build quality: The G3 just feels ‘right’. When you bend the device ever so slightly you can feel that LG put some time into designing this device to be durable, and it shows.\\n* Storage: The LG G3 comes with 32GB of storage, as well as a slot for a Micro SD card. The iPhone can’t match that…\\n* Gaming performance: Ok yeah, this was a big deal for me because I do game on my phones. The Mali 400 GPU works great on the G3 and appears to keep up with the latest in mobile 3D gaming titles. Playing Real Racing 3 and the Final Fantasy titles is a joy on the G3.\\n* Camera: The picture quality with the 13MP camera in the G3 was much better than the camera in the iPhone 6 ---- Well, it was much better in my opinion in my limited testing. And I thought the camera in the G3 was much better than the camera in the Note 3 too. I’ve already started taking pictures of my famliy with the G3 and it is worlds better than anything I’ve used in the past.\\n* The rear power and volume buttons: This was a surprising feature with the phone when I first used it. The power and volume buttons are on the back of the device. I’ve heard of people hating the back buttons on the G2\\\\. But for me, this was a selling feature of the G3 and one of the reasons why I chose the G3 over the others. I like the buttons on the back. They don’t get in the way of holding the phone and, in fact, make it easier to hold the phone in one hand.\\n* Battery Life: The LG G3 has a Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery, that equates to up to 14 hours of non-stop talk time. In recent tests the iPhone 6 caps out at 7.5 hours of non-stop talk time. Here is a better example: I’ve owned the G3 for two days now and charged it only once for 3 hours and I use it all the time to read email, game, and watch video. I still have to charge my iPhone 4s overnight as well as during the day even with light usage.\\n\\nI knew nothing about the G3 phone before I picked it up in the store. I checked out both the black and white models but eventually settled with the black model and am very happy with it.\\n\\n### Final Thoughts\\n\\nI was very opinionated when I walked into my Verizon store to look for a new phone. Also, I’m very picky on what I choose as my daily driver. But I’m very happy with my purchase because the G3 works for me. Some people have issues with the screen size, or that the back of the device is too slippery, or the back buttons are strange to them, but I don’t have any of those issues. So far, the only thing I don’t like about the phone has nothing to do with LG, it has to do with what Verizon did. First, Verizon doesn’t sell the LG G3 model with the Qi wireless charging compatible backing with the phone. It is a separate purchase. And second, yes there is quite a few Verizon app bloatware pre-installed on the phone image. But the good news is that you can disable the ones you don’t need or use.\\n\\nAfter I picked up the G3, one of my friends shot me a message telling me that LG has a promotion right now where they will send a free 2nd battery and charger when you purchase a new G3! A great deal indeed. I’ve already started to look up the wireless charging and bluetooth accessories for the LG G3 as well. I’m looking forward to using the G3 for a while.\\n\\nSorry if this seemed like a sales pitch for the G3\\\\. This is just my experience. Maybe in the future I’ll jump ship back to iPhone, but for now LG definitely has a winner.\\n\\n- Joe\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><img src=\"http://drop.ndtv.com/TECH/product_database/images/527201482115PM_635_lg_g3.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The mobile phone arena has been very lively as of late, with Apple’s release of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, Apple’s iOS 8 release, Windows Phone and Nokia having new models, and also with Samsung releasing the Note 4 very soon. And rumor has it that Google will be releasing Android L in a few short months. So as you can see there has been quite a bit of talk about mobile. And with all of this talk, I’ve had mobile phone fever. It was time for me to select my next daily driver.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyupgrade\">Why upgrade?</h2>\n<p>For the past year my daily driver has been the iPhone 4s.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.apple.com/lae/iphone-4s/specs/images/product_controls.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The reason why I’ve been using it is because my job provided me with it for work purposes. Over the past 14 months it more or less has gotten the job done. I’ve been able to respond to work emails, use the tethering here and there, and use Facetime when needed. However my 4s has been performing poorly much more often than normal. So naturally I’ve been wanting to upgrade to something else. For the curious, here is a list of the problems that I’ve been having with my 4s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The external speaker has been cutting out at random times. When the phone rings, I only catch the calls half the time because the speaker never rings the call. I can’t narrow this down when or how the problem occurs, but it started after I upgraded the phone to iOS 7. I never had this problem when it was running iOS 6. I’ve read this is a common problem with the 4s…</li>\n<li>Phone performance has degraded quite a bit over the past year. There are various performance issues with my 4s where apps sometimes fail to open and I need to force close the app and try again. For example, the “Phone app” displays a grey screen instead of displaying the dialer sometimes. Yes, I do subscribe to podcasts and stream music daily. So I believe most of my performance problems is likely has to do with flash memory performance over time. The only solution for this is to get a newer device. For those that don’t know about why flash memory performance breaks down over time, I suggest you read this article.</li>\n<li>The small screen size doesn’t help. Sure I’ve been dealing with the 3.5 inch screen since last year and I’ve put up with it. But reading articles or reading emails on that tiny screen is really annoying. It is time to get something bigger.</li>\n<li>Battery life has severely degraded over the past year as well. When I first got the phone, a full charge in the morning allows me to use the 4s throughout the entire work day. This includes listening to a full hour of music or podcasts in the morning, making and taking iMessages and up to 5 phone calls (at 10 minutes per call) during the day, another hour of podcasting on my way home, and light usage until 8pm at night. I used to still have 30% battery life left at the end of the day. Nowadays my 4s would be dead before I leave the office to drive home --- and no, I don’t have Facebook installed on it and I don’t use GPS often.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So I’ve pretty much had enough with the iPhone 4s. It is time for me to upgrade! But to what device, and why?</p>\n<h2 id=\"myrequirements\">My Requirements</h2>\n<p>I came up with several requirements and my friends helped me write them down:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Large bright screen</li>\n<li>Video chat support for Facetime or Skype</li>\n<li>Long battery life</li>\n<li>Cisco AnyConnect in App Store</li>\n<li>Great camera with flash</li>\n<li>Chromecast support</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Right off the bat, I was a bit disappointed. Because of my requirements above I couldn’t choose a Windows Phone. I’ve heard of many people that love their Windows Phones, and I’ve heard of many people that hate them too. But I want to try a Windows Phone anyways and see how it goes for me. But without Chromecast supported apps or Cisco AnyConnect VPN I just can’t choose a Windows Phone – not right now. I’m a Verizon customer, so is most of my family and a large number of my colleagues. So I knew I was going to stick with Verizon again when I upgraded.</p>\n<h2 id=\"evaluation\">Evaluation</h2>\n<p>I walked into the Verizon store and looked at all of the devices available. First was the Samsung wall. I looked at the Galaxy Note 3 first.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.3g.co.uk/g_phones/large/samsung-galaxy-note-3-review-2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>It was in it’s folio case so I got to check out the entire feature set. The screen was nice and bright and it was very responsive. The phone is huge! But after playing around with it for a few minutes, for me it was just too big. Now I am a big guy myself – I’m 6’5 and 300 pounds, and I have huge hands too (I can easily palm an NBA regulation sized basketball). But the device just didn’t feel right in one hand. The more I evaluated the Note 3 I came to the conclusion that I would be forced to use it most of the time with 2 hands. I did like the Note 3 but I kept eyeing the phone next to it – the Galaxy S4.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.thedroidguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S4.jpg?617318\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>So I picked up the S4 and played around with it too. The S4 does have a very nice screen. But the device just didn’t feel right in my hands for some reason. The build quality was a bit questionable for my tastes, too ‘plasticy’. My wife has an S4 and she loves it but I’m picky. A Galaxy S5 was right next to the S4 so I checked that out too.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.t-mobile.com/content/dam/tmo/en-g/hotspot/rockford_hotspotflat_1240x700_mainimage.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I liked the screen and the look and feel of the S5 much more than the S4. The S5 was light in the hand, was very responsive, and felt more durable than the S4. Also the back cover of the phone was less prone to slipping out of the hand than the S4. A colleague of mine has the Galaxy S5 Active on AT&amp;T and he swears by it. He showed me a 1080p recording on it too, which was fantastic! I kept on playing around with the S5 and opened apps, called my phone to check the call quality, and took a few pics on the device just to see what it was like. My only gripe was that the Samsung devices still use TouchWiz UI which I do not like, but I could deal with it if needed. At this point the S5 was at the top of my list but I needed to check out the rest of the phones. I wanted to make sure I was making the right choice for me.</p>\n<p>Right next to the Galaxy devices was the HTC One M8 Windows edition.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/htc-one-m8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Man, that is a really really nice phone! It is metal, has two speakers on the front, and the screen was awesome. Then next to that was the Nokia Lumia Icon Windows phone.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cmsresources.windowsphone.com/windowsphone/en-US/cmpn/Nokia-Lumia-Icon/carousel/hero-state5.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I must say that trying to pick out either the HTC or the Lumia was like Sophie’s choice.

So I believe most of my\n   performance problems is likely has to do with flash memory performance over\n   time. The only solution for this is to get a newer device. For those that\n   don’t know about why flash memory performance breaks down over time, I\n   suggest you read this article.\n * The small screen size doesn’t help. Sure I’ve been dealing with the 3.5 inch\n   screen since last year and I’ve put up with it. But reading articles or\n   reading emails on that tiny screen is really annoying. It is time to get\n   something bigger.\n * Battery life has severely degraded over the past year as well. When I first\n   got the phone, a full charge in the morning allows me to use the 4s\n   throughout the entire work day. This includes listening to a full hour of\n   music or podcasts in the morning, making and taking iMessages and up to 5\n   phone calls (at 10 minutes per call) during the day, another hour of\n   podcasting on my way home, and light usage until 8pm at night. I used to\n   still have 30% battery life left at the end of the day. Nowadays my 4s would\n   be dead before I leave the office to drive home --- and no, I don’t have\n   Facebook installed on it and I don’t use GPS often.\n\nSo I’ve pretty much had enough with the iPhone 4s. It is time for me to upgrade!\nBut to what device, and why?\n\nMy Requirements\nI came up with several requirements and my friends helped me write them down:\n\n 1. Large bright screen\n 2. Video chat support for Facetime or Skype\n 3. Long battery life\n 4. Cisco AnyConnect in App Store\n 5. Great camera with flash\n 6. Chromecast support\n\nRight off the bat, I was a bit disappointed. Because of my requirements above I\ncouldn’t choose a Windows Phone. I’ve heard of many people that love their\nWindows Phones, and I’ve heard of many people that hate them too. But I want to\ntry a Windows Phone anyways and see how it goes for me. But without Chromecast\nsupported apps or Cisco AnyConnect VPN I just can’t choose a Windows Phone – not\nright now. I’m a Verizon customer, so is most of my family and a large number of\nmy colleagues. So I knew I was going to stick with Verizon again when I\nupgraded.\n\nEvaluation\nI walked into the Verizon store and looked at all of the devices available.\nFirst was the Samsung wall. I looked at the Galaxy Note 3 first.\n\n\n\nIt was in it’s folio case so I got to check out the entire feature set. The\nscreen was nice and bright and it was very responsive. The phone is huge! But\nafter playing around with it for a few minutes, for me it was just too big. Now\nI am a big guy myself – I’m 6’5 and 300 pounds, and I have huge hands too (I can\neasily palm an NBA regulation sized basketball). But the device just didn’t feel\nright in one hand. The more I evaluated the Note 3 I came to the conclusion that\nI would be forced to use it most of the time with 2 hands. I did like the Note 3\nbut I kept eyeing the phone next to it – the Galaxy S4.\n\n\n\nSo I picked up the S4 and played around with it too. The S4 does have a very\nnice screen. But the device just didn’t feel right in my hands for some reason.\nThe build quality was a bit questionable for my tastes, too ‘plasticy’. My wife\nhas an S4 and she loves it but I’m picky. A Galaxy S5 was right next to the S4\nso I checked that out too.\n\n\n\nI liked the screen and the look and feel of the S5 much more than the S4. The S5\nwas light in the hand, was very responsive, and felt more durable than the S4.\nAlso the back cover of the phone was less prone to slipping out of the hand than\nthe S4. A colleague of mine has the Galaxy S5 Active on AT&T and he swears by\nit. He showed me a 1080p recording on it too, which was fantastic! I kept on\nplaying around with the S5 and opened apps, called my phone to check the call\nquality, and took a few pics on the device just to see what it was like. My only\ngripe was that the Samsung devices still use TouchWiz UI which I do not like,\nbut I could deal with it if needed. At this point the S5 was at the top of my\nlist but I needed to check out the rest of the phones. I wanted to make sure I\nwas making the right choice for me.\n\nRight next to the Galaxy devices was the HTC One M8 Windows edition.\n\n\n\nMan, that is a really really nice phone! It is metal, has two speakers on the\nfront, and the screen was awesome. Then next to that was the Nokia Lumia Icon\nWindows phone.\n\n\n\nI must say that trying to pick out either the HTC or the Lumia was like Sophie’s\nchoice. It is really hard to pick the one over the other. But if I had to pick\none, I’d choose the Lumia Icon. I just liked the Lumia Icon more than the HTC.\nBut I was forced to pass them up because of my requirements. Sorry, maybe in a\nfew months there will be Cisco AnyConnect support in Windows Phone…\n\nNext up was the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.\n\n\n\nI picked up the iPhone 6 first just to feel it in the hands and it did look and\nfelt great. It was light, much lighter than my 4s to my surprise. It was\nresponsive when swiping the screens, launching apps, and it took great pictures.\nThe screen resolution and brightness was also fantastic. The whole device feels\nreally good. I was also happy to see the iPhone 6 screen size. It seems like\nApple finally got the right screen size for their phones in the iPhone 6. Right\nnext to it was the iPhone 6 Plus. Just like the iPhone 6 it also felt great in\nthe hand, but I put it down after 30 seconds. I just knew that I wasn’t going to\nselect that phone. I had the same assessment of the 6 Plus that I did with the\nGalaxy Note 3. See, I’m not an iPhone fanboy or an Android fanboy. I just like\nto use what works for me. The iPhone 4s has been working for me just fine for\nquite some time so I knew that if I selected the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus that would\nwork fine for me too. But I wanted to keep looking…\n\nThen I stumbled upon the Motorola Droid wall and checked out the Moto X but it\nwas the previous model. I also looked at the Droid MAXX, but I know that phone\nwon’t be getting the Android L release. So long story short I passed up all of\nthe Motorola devices.\n\nFinally, the LG wall. I haven’t used an LG phone for at least 4 years now. The\nlast LG phone I had was the enV2. Remember those “text messaging” specialty\nphones? Yeah, the enV2 was one of them. The first LG phone I checked out was the\nLG G Vista.\n\n\n\nThe screenshot above really doesn’t do the device justice. With a 5.7 inch\nscreen size it is a HUGE device! Even larger than the Note 3. But it is pretty\nmuch a budget phablet with mid-range internals. I did like it at first, but then\nI did the screen readability test and it failed. ----- Here is one way to test\nscreen resolution on a phone: Open the browser and navigate to\nnews.ycombinator.com. Can you easily read the tiny text on the screen? If you\nnotice pixelation then the screen resolution isn’t that high and you might want\nto pass. If you can read every single word without squinting then you’ve got a\nwinner! ----- the G Vista was also a bit sluggish when opening apps and swiping\nfrom screen to screen. And the device was just too large for me (even the Note 3\nwas too large for me). But it was still a nice phone. Next to that was the LG\nG2.\n\n\n\nThe G2 is smaller in size than the G Vista, but is larger than the Samsung\nGalaxy S4. I love how the G2 felt in the hand and it was a little heavier than\nothers but it still felt great and performed great. The back button placement\nwas a bit strange to me but an interesting feature nonetheless.\n\nBut then next to that was the LG G3.\n\n\n\nThis device has a 5.5 inch double 1080p screen and is wider than the Apple or\nSamsung phones, which I liked. I don’t really like the “tall” screens in the\niPhones or the Note devices. I do prefer the wider screen. When I performed the\nscreen readability test, the G3 passed it with flying colors as well. The back\nbuttons on the G3 felt a lot better than the ones on the G2. I loaded up Beach\nBuggy Blitz (a great game to test out gaming performance on a mobile device) to\nget a feel for what type of gaming experience I could get on the phone too. I\njust kept falling in love with this device the longer I played with it. The\ncamera was very responsive too.\n\nThe Moment of Truth: Why the LG G3?\nI went back to all of the phones I checked out before. It was a toss up between\nthe iPhone 6 (not the 6 Plus) and the LG G3. If I selected the iPhone 6 I had a\nlot of benefits including:\n\n * Easier migration from my iPhone 4s\n * I’m already familiar in how to work with iOS\n * Met all of my current requirements\n * Will have at least 3 years of software updates (seems to be the current\n   support lifecycle for iOS)\n\nBut I still had a lot of reasons to NOT select the iPhone 6. I’ll give you three\nfor now. First, I really REALLY don’t like the price. Maybe I’m too frugal but I\nthink that paying $649 for a 16GB iPhone is WAY too much. Also, would it really\nkill Apple to increase the default storage to 32GB? Memory is incredibly cheap\nnowadays and 16GB just doesn’t cut it anymore. My second reason is that I don’t\nlike being tied to a single ecosystem. iOS is locked down and a less ‘open’\nsystem. Personally I don’t like that. And my third reason is iOS. I am just not\na fan of iOS. The design from iOS6 to iOS7 was interesting, but it just doesn’t\nwork for me. Also, since going to iOS7 my phone’s stability has drastically\ndecreased (as explained above). So who’s to say that iOS 8 would be any better?\n\nAfter going back to each phone I kept on coming back to the LG G3. I just loved\nthat phone. For me, it was about the things below:\n\n * Software: Even though it had some UI overlays, it felt pretty close to the\n   stock Android OS which I loved. I knew that I could disable any apps or\n   services I didn’t like (like NFL Mobile) and install a different keyboard,\n   amongst other changes. Android is a more ‘open’ system as well so things can\n   be changed to my liking. And with the large amount of apps in the Google Play\n   store I could find any app to help me get most any job done.\n * Screen size: I don’t like the “tall” iPhone screens. The G3 was a bit wider\n   which I liked. The device isn’t quite a phablet, which is a good thing.\n * Device build quality: The G3 just feels ‘right’. When you bend the device\n   ever so slightly you can feel that LG put some time into designing this\n   device to be durable, and it shows.\n * Storage: The LG G3 comes with 32GB of storage, as well as a slot for a Micro\n   SD card. The iPhone can’t match that…\n * Gaming performance: Ok yeah, this was a big deal for me because I do game on\n   my phones. The Mali 400 GPU works great on the G3 and appears to keep up with\n   the latest in mobile 3D gaming titles. Playing Real Racing 3 and the Final\n   Fantasy titles is a joy on the G3.\n * Camera: The picture quality with the 13MP camera in the G3 was much better\n   than the camera in the iPhone 6 ---- Well, it was much better in my opinion\n   in my limited testing. And I thought the camera in the G3 was much better\n   than the camera in the Note 3 too. I’ve already started taking pictures of my\n   famliy with the G3 and it is worlds better than anything I’ve used in the\n   past.\n * The rear power and volume buttons: This was a surprising feature with the\n   phone when I first used it. The power and volume buttons are on the back of\n   the device. I’ve heard of people hating the back buttons on the G2. But for\n   me, this was a selling feature of the G3 and one of the reasons why I chose\n   the G3 over the others. I like the buttons on the back. They don’t get in the\n   way of holding the phone and, in fact, make it easier to hold the phone in\n   one hand.\n * Battery Life: The LG G3 has a Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery, that equates to up to\n   14 hours of non-stop talk time. In recent tests the iPhone 6 caps out at 7.5\n   hours of non-stop talk time. Here is a better example: I’ve owned the G3 for\n   two days now and charged it only once for 3 hours and I use it all the time\n   to read email, game, and watch video. I still have to charge my iPhone 4s\n   overnight as well as during the day even with light usage.\n\nI knew nothing about the G3 phone before I picked it up in the store. I checked\nout both the black and white models but eventually settled with the black model\nand am very happy with it.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI was very opinionated when I walked into my Verizon store to look for a new\nphone. Also, I’m very picky on what I choose as my daily driver. But I’m very\nhappy with my purchase because the G3 works for me. Some people have issues with\nthe screen size, or that the back of the device is too slippery, or the back\nbuttons are strange to them, but I don’t have any of those issues. So far, the\nonly thing I don’t like about the phone has nothing to do with LG, it has to do\nwith what Verizon did. First, Verizon doesn’t sell the LG G3 model with the Qi\nwireless charging compatible backing with the phone. It is a separate purchase.\nAnd second, yes there is quite a few Verizon app bloatware pre-installed on the\nphone image. But the good news is that you can disable the ones you don’t need\nor use.\n\nAfter I picked up the G3, one of my friends shot me a message telling me that LG\nhas a promotion right now where they will send a free 2nd battery and charger\nwhen you purchase a new G3! A great deal indeed. I’ve already started to look up\nthe wireless charging and bluetooth accessories for the LG G3 as well. I’m\nlooking forward to using the G3 for a while.\n\nSorry if this seemed like a sales pitch for the G3. This is just my experience.\nMaybe in the future I’ll jump ship back to iPhone, but for now LG definitely has\na winner.\n\n * Joe","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2014-09-26T03:18:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2014-09-26T03:18:05.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2014-09-26T03:18:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc781","uuid":"6bd72cae-ef33-4561-bc43-e670e40906e7","title":"Language Used in Discussion about Net Neutrality and Peering","slug":"language_used_in_discussion_about_net_neutrality_and_peering","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"**< Please see my disclaimers at the bottom of this article. >**A great deal of the discussions about net neutrality and the Netflix peering deals have me concerned because of the language people have chosen to use when discussing these topics.

One of the most interesting and uniquely gratifying roles I serve is being one of the \\\"the app monitoring guys\\\" or \\\"the SolarWinds guys\\\". Since I it seems suiting that I wear that hat. Like thousands of other organizations, we use SolarWinds SAM to monitor a wide array of infrastructure and business applications. Recently we ran into a snag with trying to monitor one of our more critical apps, so I'd like to share how\\\\what we did to resolve that problem using Windows Powershell.... \\n\\nOne of our critical applications runs for a few hours each day starting at 6am then closes on its own anywhere from 10am or 4pm or even 2am the next day. When the application process finishes and closes depends on the day the application is launched - some days have more data to process than the others. In addition, there cannot be more than one instance of this application running at one time or the 4 or 10 or 24 hour process will have to start all over (which will delay some of our core business units' daily numbers). This poses a unique problem when trying to monitor this application in SolarWinds SAM. \\n\\nHere is the biggest limitation of any application monitoring solution --- SAM expects an application to always be up\\\\running in order for the alerts to properly work and also to show if the application is up\\\\down on the web dashboard. This isn't only the default way SolarWinds SAM monitors applications, it is by design. Unfortunately there isn't an out-of-the-box solution for monitoring applications \\\"intermittently\\\". To be perfectly honest, I'm not surprised that SolarWinds SAM would include such a feature out-of-the-box. I mean, why the heck would you want to monitor an application only \\\"part of the time\\\" anyways? Trying to set up a proper alert for an intermittent application would be troublesome if not impossible. But this is just what I need to do with this specific business application. Also, I needed to monitor if there are more than one instance of the application running on the server. The default app monitors in SAM just won't suit my needs here. Instead, what I needed to do was utilize the feature in SAM where I can create my own custom app monitor using a script. And Windows Powershell does the job nicely. \\n\\nI created a Windows Powershell script that finds out how many instances of the application's Windows process is running at the same time returns the value in the variable $stat, only if the process is running.

First, the script determines if the process name 'Notepad' (defined in $processname) is running at all. If it is, then it will find out the current instance count and store it in the variable $stat. If the process is not running, then $stat will equal a numeric '0'. Finally, we write the message information and statistic information to the screen. The message ($msg variable) is just for SolarWinds SAM use - it is something to display in the dashboard instead of leaving a big question mark on the app monitor details view. The $stat variable is the important one since this is the numeric value needed by SAM. We set the threshold to '1' in the SAM settings for this monitor. When the threshold is reached an alert will be generated in SolarWinds. Bada boom bada bing. \\n\\nThis monitor works great for us since it helps us utilize SAM without circumventing the way it works. The script monitor is in 'good' status (or 'green' status) when the value is 0 or 1, which is exactly what we expect because either the application is not running at the time the script is executed or there should only be one instance of the process running. We only want to know if there are 2 or more instances of the process running on the computer - nothing else. We have to use a different application monitor in SAM to find out if this 6am process did not execute when we needed it to, so I'm not concerned about including that information here at this time :) \\n\\nThis script can be used not only in SolarWinds SAM, but your own custom solutions or projects.

That person leans in towards you and looks you in the eye like they've been dying to ask this question the entire conversation, and with an eagerness and a genuine smile they ask \\\"So, tell me something... how much _FUN_ are you having on the job?\\\" \\nWow... Just think about how much power that question can have. Has anyone ever asked you that question before without being sarcastic or with a negative overtone?

I'm sure if you had some of these positive answers you'd be looking forward to going to work the next day, am I right? If we were that positive about our jobs we would head to work ready to hit the ground running! But I know that some of you are still working on trying to muster up the courage to attempt to answer the question. Some of you may be really asking yourself, \\\"Do I _ever_ have fun on the job?\\\". I imagine some negative responses might include things like: \\n\\n* You don't understand the things that I have to do just to get a paycheck every week.\\n* I have a terrible boss and I can't stand working for him\\\\her.\\n* I haven't had a day off of work in a month and no one cares about it.\\n* I work all day, then I come home and I have to work even more!\\n* My co-workers earn more money than I do.\\n* My co-workers don't come close to working as hard as I do!\\n* I don't believe in the products my business makes and\\\\or the services they offer.\\n* Other people don't have the setbacks that I experience every day.\\n* One of my co-workers just got promoted and they haven't been working here as long as I have!\\n* I'm stuck right where I am and I can't get out.\\n* I don't know why I even work here.\\n\\nor even the worst of the worst.... \\n\\n* **I hate my job**.\\n\\nOuch... We've all been there before haven't we? Some of you may even be there right now. I can still remember when I said those dreaded words about some of my bosses, some of my co-workers, or some of the companies I've worked for. It doesn't feel good to say those bad things does it? \\nI've had the privilege of being able to work for many different businesses, many different bosses, and work with many different people throughout my career. I've had plenty of jobs where I was excited to get to work in the morning, and I've had jobs where I dreaded walking in the door. Even today I have setbacks just like you. There are times where someone does not do something they are supposed to do and it affects my work. I have to deal with irate customers and I have many different people that jump down my throat about various issues here and there. There are even times where I make mistakes and it affects other people's work! In my past I have even made mistakes that cost me my job. None of these things helped reduce my stress level. None. Just imagine if I had these negative thoughts all day long. I doubt anyone would want to talk to me, let alone work with me. Do you know what these negative thoughts about our jobs do to our perception about our workplace, or our bosses, or the businesses we work for? It impacts the way we work, how we work, and it impacts the quality of work that we produce. These thoughts set us up for failure and causes increased stress in the workplace. \\nIn 2010, The American Psychological Association published a that displayed some very interesting research done about workplace stress. Here are a few of them: \\n\\n* 69% of employees say their work is a significant source of stress in their lives.\\n* 51% of employees say they were less productive due to stress.\\n* Health care expenses for employees with high levels of stress were 46% higher compared to those without.\\n* Job stress is estimated to cost U.S. industry more than $300 billion a year in absenteeism, turnover, diminished productivity and medical, legal and insurance costs.\\n\\nThese are some very substantial numbers and facts and simply put -- they are **DISTURBING**. Just look at what we are doing to ourselves when we complain about our jobs or when we stress out about our work. IT IS DISTURBING. But I have come to realize a few things… \\nI have discovered that 100% of the people that are unhappy about their jobs do not feel good about their jobs. But wait! There's more... I've also discovered that 100% of the people that feel good about their jobs are actually HAPPY about their jobs! Yes! I have found that it FEELS GOOD TO BE HAPPY! And when someone does NOT feel good, THEY ARE NOT HAPPY! \\nSo how should we respond when feeling negative about our work? How can we transform our way of thinking about our work? \\n\\nI just finished reading an article by one of my good friends at called . It is an excellent article and I highly suggest you read it. At the top of the article there is a quote that says \\\"Whatever happens, you always have a choice -- you are always able to choose your response.\\\" After having said many of the negative things listed above in this article I made the choice long ago that I will never allow myself to hate my job ever again and if I do, I will be the one to change my situation. Every day I make the choice to do everything I can to be a better employee today than I was yesterday. We are all given the opportunity to respond, either positively or negatively, about our jobs. And every day that I work, I **PLAN** on having fun at work. \\n\\n### Having a plan means that I am intentionally going to follow through \\nwith what I say that I am going to do.\\n\\nHaving a plan to have fun on the job means that I am intentionally going to have a positive attitude regardless of the setbacks that I encounter. If I wake up in the morning, and I PLAN on having a great day at work that day then I <u>will</u> have a great day! When I plan on having fun at work, it affects not only myself but my attitude affects everyone around me too. There is this tremendous positive energy that flows outward from myself towards others. This positive energy helps me to perform well at my tasks and projects. And when I perform well on the job, I feel a sense accomplishment and personal satisfaction in the work that I do. I have this sense of empowerment and feel that I have a long future in the company. When I have fun on the job I feel that I am a valuable team member in my workplace. Ladies and gentleman, this type of positive attitude is contagious. Everyone around me lights up. My colleagues are happy to work with me to achieve my goals and I am more than happy to help them achieve their own goals. \\n\\n\\\"But Joe, you just don't understand my situation. It just isn't that easy to 'flip the switch' and just feel good about my job.\\\" I know it isn't easy but the more you work on your own attitude about work, the better it will get. If you are in a constant struggle with your boss or your place of employment or you still find it difficult to have fun on the job no matter what you do, I recommend you read the article by my good friend at . You are never stuck. There is always a way out of the rut that you are in. My point is this... \\n\\n### \\\"If you target nothing, you'll hit it every time.\\\" - Zig Ziglar\\n\\n<u>I want you to wake up tomorrow and plan on having fun on the job.</u> If you do this every day I guarantee that it will make a tremendous difference in your career. Your co-workers and your bosses will notice the difference as well. And you know what? When you plan on having fun at your job, and you actually _HAVE FUN_, I guarantee that you will make a positive impact on someone else that might have negative thoughts about their job. \\n\\nPlan on having fun on the job so that you not only make a difference in your own career, but your colleagues' careers too. \\n\\n[EquipYourLife.org](https://www.blogger.com/www.equipyourlife.org)\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Imagine that you are talking with your boss, or a possible employer, or friend, family member, or even a complete stranger about what you do for a living.

If I wake up in the morning, and I PLAN on having a great day at work that day then I <u>will</u> have a great day! When I plan on having fun at work, it affects not only myself but my attitude affects everyone around me too. There is this tremendous positive energy that flows outward from myself towards others. This positive energy helps me to perform well at my tasks and projects. And when I perform well on the job, I feel a sense accomplishment and personal satisfaction in the work that I do. I have this sense of empowerment and feel that I have a long future in the company. When I have fun on the job I feel that I am a valuable team member in my workplace. Ladies and gentleman, this type of positive attitude is contagious. Everyone around me lights up.

You\ndiscuss where you work, how you work, what your duties are, and other things of\nthe sort. But then the other person throws you a curve ball question. That\nperson leans in towards you and looks you in the eye like they've been dying to\nask this question the entire conversation, and with an eagerness and a genuine\nsmile they ask \"So, tell me something... how much FUN  are you having on the\njob?\"\nWow... Just think about how much power that question can have. Has anyone ever\nasked you that question before without being sarcastic or with a negative\novertone? Better yet, have you asked yourself that question ever in your life?\nIt is a powerful question! Go ahead - stop reading this article and ask yourself\nright now,\n\n\"How much fun  am I  having on the job?\"\nNow, when you answered this question did a lot of positive thoughts pass through\nyour mind? If you did, maybe some of the positive responses included things\nlike:\n\n * I get to work on complex projects.\n * I get to learn this and do that.\n * I get to create interesting solutions to problems at work.\n * I get to teach others and I get to be a teacher.\n * I get to work with various customers.\n * I get to sell my business's excellent products that I believe in and use\n   myself.\n * I get to share my experiences with my co-workers and we have the opportunity\n   to learn a lot of things from each other.\n * I get to help achieve the business's goals.\n * and so on\n\nIf you did respond with some of these positive responses I'm certain you were\nable to answer that question fast! I'm sure if you had some of these positive\nanswers you'd be looking forward to going to work the next day, am I right? If\nwe were that positive about our jobs we would head to work ready to hit the\nground running! But I know that some of you are still working on trying to\nmuster up the courage to attempt to answer the question. Some of you may be\nreally asking yourself, \"Do I ever  have fun on the job?\". I imagine some\nnegative responses might include things like:\n\n * You don't understand the things that I have to do just to get a paycheck\n   every week.\n * I have a terrible boss and I can't stand working for him\\her.\n * I haven't had a day off of work in a month and no one cares about it.\n * I work all day, then I come home and I have to work even more!\n * My co-workers earn more money than I do.\n * My co-workers don't come close to working as hard as I do!\n * I don't believe in the products my business makes and\\or the services they\n   offer.\n * Other people don't have the setbacks that I experience every day.\n * One of my co-workers just got promoted and they haven't been working here as\n   long as I have!\n * I'm stuck right where I am and I can't get out.\n * I don't know why I even work here.\n\nor even the worst of the worst....\n\n * I hate my job.\n\nOuch... We've all been there before haven't we? Some of you may even be there\nright now. I can still remember when I said those dreaded words about some of my\nbosses, some of my co-workers, or some of the companies I've worked for. It\ndoesn't feel good to say those bad things does it?\nI've had the privilege of being able to work for many different businesses, many\ndifferent bosses, and work with many different people throughout my career. I've\nhad plenty of jobs where I was excited to get to work in the morning, and I've\nhad jobs where I dreaded walking in the door. Even today I have setbacks just\nlike you. There are times where someone does not do something they are supposed\nto do and it affects my work. I have to deal with irate customers and I have\nmany different people that jump down my throat about various issues here and\nthere. There are even times where I make mistakes and it affects other people's\nwork! In my past I have even made mistakes that cost me my job. None of these\nthings helped reduce my stress level. None. Just imagine if I had these negative\nthoughts all day long. I doubt anyone would want to talk to me, let alone work\nwith me. Do you know what these negative thoughts about our jobs do to our\nperception about our workplace, or our bosses, or the businesses we work for? It\nimpacts the way we work, how we work, and it impacts the quality of work that we\nproduce. These thoughts set us up for failure and causes increased stress in the\nworkplace.\nIn 2010, The American Psychological Association published a that displayed some\nvery interesting research done about workplace stress. Here are a few of them:\n\n * 69% of employees say their work is a significant source of stress in their\n   lives.\n * 51% of employees say they were less productive due to stress.\n * Health care expenses for employees with high levels of stress were 46% higher\n   compared to those without.\n * Job stress is estimated to cost U.S. industry more than $300 billion a year\n   in absenteeism, turnover, diminished productivity and medical, legal and\n   insurance costs.\n\nThese are some very substantial numbers and facts and simply put -- they are \nDISTURBING. Just look at what we are doing to ourselves when we complain about\nour jobs or when we stress out about our work. IT IS DISTURBING. But I have come\nto realize a few things…\nI have discovered that 100% of the people that are unhappy about their jobs do\nnot feel good about their jobs. But wait! There's more... I've also discovered\nthat 100% of the people that feel good about their jobs are actually HAPPY about\ntheir jobs! Yes! I have found that it FEELS GOOD TO BE HAPPY! And when someone\ndoes NOT feel good, THEY ARE NOT HAPPY!\nSo how should we respond when feeling negative about our work? How can we\ntransform our way of thinking about our work?\n\nI just finished reading an article by one of my good friends at called . It is\nan excellent article and I highly suggest you read it. At the top of the article\nthere is a quote that says \"Whatever happens, you always have a choice -- you\nare always able to choose your response.\" After having said many of the negative\nthings listed above in this article I made the choice long ago that I will never\nallow myself to hate my job ever again and if I do, I will be the one to change\nmy situation.

I know this will help others that made the same mistakes that I did. I'm grateful to have the ability to assist others in their projects. In addition to helping my clients achieve their goals, I am able to learn new skills along the way which then I am able to share with others. Knowledge truly is power. Today's blog post is information about a mistake I made while working on a client's server, as well as how to fix the problem.\\n\\nMy client's request was simple; they wanted to upgrade all of their servers from Windows Server 2012 to Windows Server 2012 R2\\\\. They had one server running SQL Server 2012 RTM, one virtual machine running Sharepoint Server 2013 RTM, then a handful of some other virtual servers running Windows Server 2012\\\\. They have a single hardware server running Windows Server 2012 RTM and all of their workloads run in Hyper-V virtual machines on this physical server. Backups are properly configured.\\n\\nI will continue with describing my mistake:\\n\\n* On the SQL Server 2012 virtual machine, I captured a VM snapshot, attached the 2012 R2 ISO to the virtual machine settings, executed setup.exe from the disk, then started the upgrade.\\n* On the Sharepoint Server 2013 server, I attached the 2012 R2 ISO to the virtual machine settings, executed setup.exe from the disk, then started the upgrade.\\n\\nSo first off, there is one very important mistake I made -- I did NOT do any research on application compatibility for SQL Server 2012 for Server 2012 R2, or for Sharepoint 2013 running on Windows Server 2012 R2 either. If I knew the requirements before the upgrade, I would have made sure  The 2nd mistake I made was NOT taking a snapshot of the Sharepoint server.\\n\\nWhen both servers started back up after the 2012 R2 upgrade, I was able to log in to each of them just fine so the OS portion was good. But both SQL Server 2012 had tons of errors and Sharepoint 2013 wouldn't display any web pages and displayed nothing but HTTP 500 errors. Shoot, what was I to do? Damage control mode. I was left with unusable SQL database and a broken Sharepoint server. Not good.\\n\\nFirst things first, I reverted back to the saved snapshot for the SQL Server. Once that was done and after I confirmed the SQL server was back in good operating condition it was time to focus on Sharepoint 2013.\\n\\nAfter several hours of trying several things, here was our fix:\\n\\n* Install SharePoint Server 2013 Service Pack 1, then reboot.\\n* Run the SharePoint Product Configuration Wizard to finish the upgrade. Reboot when prompted.\\n* Verify SharePoint sites come up without a problem.\\n\\nThe environment was finally back up and running with no more errors. From this point we made snapshots of each virtual machine then continued to perform the 2012 R2 in-place OS upgrades.\\n\\nIf you want to perform an in-place upgrade your servers from 2012 RTM to 2012 R2, this can be done successfully for most cases since 2012 to 2012 R2 in-place upgrades are supported by Microsoft. If your 2012 RTM servers are running SQL Server 2012 RTM or SharePoint Server 2013 RTM, then read the following:\\n\\n## Upgrading to Windows Server 2012 R2 from 2012 RTM for servers running SQL Server 2012 RTM.\\n\\n* First install SQL Server 2012 Service Pack 1\\\\. Reboot when prompted.\\n* Execute setup.exe from the Windows Server 2012 R2 installation media. Complete the upgrade.\\n* Done.\\n\\n## Upgrading to Windows Server 2012 R2 from 2012 RTM for servers running Sharepoint Server 2013 RTM.\\n\\n* First install SharePoint Server 2013 Service Pack 1\\\\. Reboot when prompted.\\n* Run Sharepoint Configuration Wizard to complete the upgrade. Reboot when prompted.\\n* Execute setup.exe from the Windows Server 2012 R2 installation media.

I know this will help others that made the same mistakes that I did. I'm grateful to have the ability to assist others in their projects.

Today's blog post is information about a mistake I made while working on a client's server, as well as how to fix the problem.</p>\n<p>My client's request was simple; they wanted to upgrade all of their servers from Windows Server 2012 to Windows Server 2012 R2. They had one server running SQL Server 2012 RTM, one virtual machine running Sharepoint Server 2013 RTM, then a handful of some other virtual servers running Windows Server 2012. They have a single hardware server running Windows Server 2012 RTM and all of their workloads run in Hyper-V virtual machines on this physical server. Backups are properly configured.</p>\n<p>I will continue with describing my mistake:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On the SQL Server 2012 virtual machine, I captured a VM snapshot, attached the 2012 R2 ISO to the virtual machine settings, executed setup.exe from the disk, then started the upgrade.</li>\n<li>On the Sharepoint Server 2013 server, I attached the 2012 R2 ISO to the virtual machine settings, executed setup.exe from the disk, then started the upgrade.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So first off, there is one very important mistake I made -- I did NOT do any research on application compatibility for SQL Server 2012 for Server 2012 R2, or for Sharepoint 2013 running on Windows Server 2012 R2 either. If I knew the requirements before the upgrade, I would have made sure  The 2nd mistake I made was NOT taking a snapshot of the Sharepoint server.</p>\n<p>When both servers started back up after the 2012 R2 upgrade, I was able to log in to each of them just fine so the OS portion was good. But both SQL Server 2012 had tons of errors and Sharepoint 2013 wouldn't display any web pages and displayed nothing but HTTP 500 errors. Shoot, what was I to do? Damage control mode. I was left with unusable SQL database and a broken Sharepoint server. Not good.</p>\n<p>First things first, I reverted back to the saved snapshot for the SQL Server. Once that was done and after I confirmed the SQL server was back in good operating condition it was time to focus on Sharepoint 2013.</p>\n<p>After several hours of trying several things, here was our fix:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Install SharePoint Server 2013 Service Pack 1, then reboot.</li>\n<li>Run the SharePoint Product Configuration Wizard to finish the upgrade. Reboot when prompted.</li>\n<li>Verify SharePoint sites come up without a problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The environment was finally back up and running with no more errors.

The root cause was that they were running the latest Mac OS X\nversion, 10.8 Mountain Lion,  [http://www.cisco.com]\n\nIn order to fix this specific problem we updated all of the AnyConnect client\nversions on our ASA to the latest 3.1 releases for Windows, Linux, and Mac, then\nhad our Mac users running 10.8 Mountain Lion log back into the VPN web portal.\nThey were prompted to update their AnyConnect client to the new version, which\nwe had set up on the ASA to force client updates, and now they were able to\naccess VPN without any issues.\n\nHowever, we found out that there were some caveats with updating to the\nAnyConnect 3.1 release. We now gained the ability to support 10.8 Mountain Lion\noperating systems, but 10.5 Leopard support was dropped. So unfortunately, this\nlocked out several of our customers that were still running Mac OS X 10.5\nLeopard on their Intel Macs. In short, they couldn’t connect to VPN because the\nprofile settings on our ASA are configured to force the installation of the\ncurrent edition of the AnyConnect client on the ASA in order to access VPN. When\nthe installer for the 3.1 client launched, they were presented with an error\nthat told them their operating system was not supported, then the install\nfailed. So, since these Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard users couldn't update to the\nnewest client version, they were locked out of our VPN.\n\nAs a workaround to support all of the Intel Mac OS X editions, we downgraded the\nIntel Mac AnyConnect client back to 3.0 and turned off the Auto Update feature\non the ASA. This will provide the 3.0 client for those that currently do not\nhave it, as well as not perform the auto update check. The good news is that the\nnew AnyConnect client v3.1 for Windows supports Windows XP all the way up to\nWindows 8 so there is no worries about upgrading it. Mac OS X is a different\nstory.\n\nAccording to Cisco, here is there recommended workaround to this issue:\n\n 1. Disable the client check\\Auto Update on the ASA.\n 2. If there is anyone that needs to connect to VPN with a Mac computer running\n    10.5 Leopard, downgrade the AnyConnect client to one of the 3.0 releases or\n    provide the DMG installer to the Mac user.\n 3. If there is anyone that needs to connect to VPN with a Mac computer running\n    10.8 Mountain Lion, provide the 3.1 DMG installer to that person.\n\nI hope this helps others out that are experiencing the same issues.\n\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/vpn_client/anyconnect/anyconnect31/release/notes/anyconnect31rn.html#wp44364\n\n * Joe","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2013-06-26T22:00:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2013-06-26T22:00:02.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2013-06-26T22:00:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc78a","uuid":"6a9f1aa4-5efa-4824-8744-fff044a6a552","title":"DirectAccess 2012 IP-HTTPS issue, “The IP-HTTPS listener is inactive”","slug":"direct_access_2012_ip_https_issue_the_ip_https_listener_is_inactive","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"This is now the 3<sup>rd</sup> time that I have set up a single network adapter installation of DirectAccess 2012 for one of my customers and I wanted to share my experience with one of the most common problems I’ve seen thus far.

There are teams for development, server, network, help desk, and so forth. At the time of this writing, I am a member of the network engineering team. Our entire I.T. organization also uses the same work order system or \\\"ticket system\\\" for tracking issues, problems, and user requests. In each \\\"ticket\\\", we are all expected to make notes and track our work especially adding in our troubleshooting notes and what we did to resolve the ticket. But there isn't a week that goes by where our team is assigned a ticket where there is ZERO information to go off of. If you follow my articles on this site, you are already aware that I pretty much expect \\\"\\\" to be answered in each ticket before it is escalated or re-assigned to someone else. I also expect these questions to be answered by myself and yes, I do make mistakes sometimes. But I want to bring up an internal problem that we all face too often in our I.T. roles where we completely drop the ball on writing decent documentation. \\nSo, what are some examples of poor documentation in a help desk ticket? Here are a few: \\n\\n#1\\\\. The help desk receives a call from a customer\\\\user about a problem with their computer where they cannot access the internet. From the activity logs, we see that the ticket remains in the help desk queue for several hours, and is then simply assigned to the Desktop support team to resolve with no troubleshooting notes. Then, a person on the desktop support team takes ownership of the ticket. The ticket sits in their work order queue for a few more hours, then that person assigns it to the network team with a note that says something to the effect of \\\"PC can't get online. Please check the wall jack.\\\" This is where the activity trail ends. \\n\\n#2\\\\. A desktop support team member creates a new ticket for a user because the user is unable to print to a network printer in their department. According to the activity log in the ticket, the desktop support team member noted the error that appears onscreen when trying to print from the user's computer and also has a screenshot attached to the ticket. The ticket was in the desktop support ticket queue for one hour, then was escalated to the server team with a note asking them to reboot the print server. \\n\\n#3\\\\. An developer on the web applications team opens a ticket for a customer and assigns it to desktop support asking them to assist a customer that is having issues trying to access the company's website.  There are no further notes and no details about the problem the customer is experiencing. \\n\\nIn the first scenario, we don't know if this is a widespread issue or if this is a problem localized to the customer's computer. We also have no idea what troubleshooting was done by the help desk or the desktop support team member. The network team member must now go through troubleshooting 101 all over again because there was no information on what was done in the ticket. \\n\\nThe second scenario is similar to the first. The first question that should have been answered in this ticket is \\\"Is this a widespread problem, or is only this person having a printing problem?\\\" Long story short, the problem was local to the desktop (Windows Print Spooler problem) and should have been handled at the front end. \\n\\nThe third scenario highlights internal communication problems. Sure, there are good reasons why developers shouldn't be contacting a customer directly. But the developer needs to help guide the desktop support technician in the right direction so they aren't entirely lost. \\n\\nBased on the information from the scenarios above, it is clear there is a serious breakdown of providing proper documentation. We all are very busy and we all do work very hard, but having a lack of documentation hurts everyone. Saying the \\\"I don't have the time\\\" excuse isn't an excuse at all - it is a cop out. The primary rule of working in work orders or help desk tickets is this: \\n\\n**If it isn't in the ticket, it never happened.** Just imagine that you were working on a problem for a customer and you resolved the problem and closed out the ticket without putting in your work notes. If the customer called back to complain they are still having the same problem, it would appear that you literally didn't do any work. Now imagine that you are working for a company that was being wrongfully sued by a customer due to a ticket you worked on. If you had proper documentation, you would have little to worry about. The second rule about documentation in help desk tickets is also very simple: \\n\\n**The ticket needs to tell a story.** Work notes in a ticket need to be meaningful and somewhat easy to understand in case someone else reads your notes (especially your manager). Proper notes in help desk tickets is usually proof that you are working hard, as well as learning on the job. What you or your boss should be able to do is open a closed\\\\resolved ticket and very easily be able to read out who did what in that ticket, as well as read the actual resolution of the ticket, almost like it is a story. \\n\\nLeaving out the resolution in a ticket and just saying \\\"Fixed\\\" or \\\"Done\\\" doesn't count as a proper resolution to the story. \\n\\nMake it count. \\n<u>Some facts about help desk tickets:</u> \\n* A help desk ticket can be as useful as a knowledge base article. There have been many times were I fixed a  problem for a person and the issue came up 6 months later. I've been able to go back and look up how I fixed the problem, helping me get the customer back up and running quickly instead of \\\"re-inventing the wheel\\\" all over again. \\n\\n* A help desk ticket can be used as a learning tool. For example, if you are on the help desk and had to escalate a ticket to another team, as long as the proper resolution was saved you can go back and read it further increasing your knowledge. \\n\\n* A help desk ticket can be used in court. There was a time where a ticket I closed was used in court. Thanks to the documentation in the ticket, I helped save the company I worked for millions of dollars in fines. If the work notes were not there, I may have been fired. \\n\\n* A help desk ticket can help improve your typing and communication skills. Writing good, even lengthy, documentation in a help desk ticket can be cumbersome and frustrating sometimes but the value it adds to your verbal and writing skills is priceless. With better documentation skills you can communicate what you want to say quickly, as well as help you choose proper words and descriptions to use. \\n\\nNow, I know that I have heavily focused on documentation only in help desk tickets, but the same concepts outlined in this article applies to app bug reports (saying \\\"It don't work\\\" is a useless bug report), customer facing articles, and so forth. That is all that I have to say about documentation right now. I hope this convinces you that writing good documentation is important even for help desk tickets and that you will think twice about saying \\\"I don't have the time to document\\\" or \\\"It takes too much of my time to do this\\\". \\n\\n- Joe[the 5 questions](http://www.joedissmeyer.com/2010/09/5-questions-to-ask-every-user-when.html)\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I work in a somewhat large I.T. environment where work and responsibilities are distributed<img src=\"http://www.source-il.com/image/users/59461/ftp/my_files/Work_Order_Icon.png\" alt=\"\"> amongst each team.

There were only a few days during the entire course of writing the book\nthat I needed someone to watch my kids on a Saturday so I could type as much as\nI could, but that was pretty much it.\n\nI know that not everyone is supposed to write a book, but if there is one that\nyou are thinking of writing why not give it a try? I was able to do it without\nsacrificing my personal life and I am very happy with the outcome of the book. A\nbook release can be very beneficial for your career and will help your\nconfidence. My experience in writing my first book was a positive one and I\nalready want to get started on my next project. For those that are wanting to\nstart writing, are on the fence, or are in doubt, I hope this article will help\nyou in making your decision.\n\nPackt Publishing [http://www.blogger.com/www.packtpub.com]","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2013-04-08T02:44:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2013-06-06T19:23:30.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2013-04-08T02:44:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc78d","uuid":"2d962397-2425-4b7a-b67f-03bae7c6979a","title":"Network Connections Unavailable for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS or 12.10 virtual machines in VMware ESXi","slug":"network_connections_unavailable_for_ubuntu_12_04_lts_or_12_10_virtual_machines_in_vmware_esxi","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I created several virtual machines in my VMware ESXi 5.1 host whose OS was Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Logs are a history of what is going on with your device. If you are experiencing network or wireless issues, or if an application keeps on crashing, viewing these logs will give you deeper insight on what is going on on your computer. In order to view these logs on a Mac computer running OS X, you use the Console application in Applications > Utilities. Microsoft provides a similar log viewer in the Windows world called Event Viewer, which is accessible from the Control Panel > Administrative Tools. \\nBut how can you view the logs on an iOS device such as an iPad or iPhone? Fortunately, it is quite easy to do. Follow the instructions below: \\n\\n1. On your Mac or Windows computer, install the free iPhone Configuration Utility from Apple's website: [http://support.apple.com/downloads/#iphone](http://support.apple.com/downloads/#iphone)\\n2. Launch the utility, then connect your iOS device to the computer.\\n3. Click on your connected device under the Device list on the left, then click on the Console tab in the main view.\\n\\nThe running logs will be displayed in the main view pane. At this point, you can start sorting through all of the logs. The search box is helpful since it acts as a filter so use it to help you narrow down your search. Also, you can save a copy of these logs to a text file for later review by clicking on the Save Console As... button on the bottom-right hand part of the window. \\nSo, the question remains, \\\"Is there an app for that?\\\" Yes, the App Store does have several apps that can emulate the Console but I have never had good luck with them. Either the app hasn't been updated for the latest iOS version, or the app freezes up when sorting through the logs, or the app won't launch. Viewing logs from the iPhone Configuration Utility is officially supported (and allowed) by Apple and almost guarantees that you will be able to view the logs on your iOS device without issues. If you have a better way of viewing logs in iOS, I'd love to hear it!

I had been a member of Facebook since mid-2008 which was shortly after my ![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yIIOo03i1og/TprxuPc7-MI/AAAAAAAAAZs/N5KI-GOGrIQ/s400/6a00e54f133d69883400e5533114fd8833-800wi.png)wife created her own account. Over the past four years I had uploaded a decent amount of family pictures to my profile, had over 300 people in my friends list, and had spent countless hours posting, re-posting, sharing, typing, and butting into various conversations and dialogue on hundreds (if not thousands) of other Facebook profiles. Most of the people I interacted with on Facebook I personally knew at one point or another either from my own experience or through my family and friends; others I did not. I shared my personal views, offered advice, posted jokes and funny comments, and tons of other things. Some of the things I posted were important, but most were not.\\n\\nFacebook had been a part of my life, as well as my entire family's life, for almost five years. It used to be a great place to share. It was clean, simple, and easy to use. But like our society, Facebook has evolved and transformed into an ugly and vile place – which is something that I think Facebook was never originally intended to be. To me, Facebook was supposed to be a safe place to connect with friends and peers that only you want to allow into your “circle of trust” [gratuitous ‘Meet the Parents’ reference]. But over the years, the circle of trust idea has exploded into something that I can barely explain. I can’t blame Zuck and his dev teams for what has happened to this amazing social system. Facebook members are what makes Facebook the type of experience it is today. Facebook is a free ecosystem - It is only as good as the people that support it which are its members. And a majority of people no longer make it an enjoyable place to spend my time. The reasons of why I closed my account are many, but there are three primary reasons why I closed my account.\\n\\nThe idea of closing my Facebook account came about during the 2012 American political election season. During the debates, the internet was rife with various opinions and ideas, and so was Facebook. I came to expect certain things to be said about each side. But this election cycle’s comments and actions by far seemed to be the most… bold… compared to what I have experienced in the past. I kept fairly quiet during the entire election cycle having only a single comment about the final Presidential Debate in October which, to my delight, did not spark any controversy. I had quietly viewed some of my family and friends’ profiles without leaving comments but decided to stop posting anything. After the elections were over, I rarely logged into my account, but I did update with short and simple comments whenever I logged in. It wasn’t until after the Sandy Hook shootings that I finally decided to close my account.\\n\\nThe main reason why I closed my account is that it is impossible to have an intelligent conversation with anyone on Facebook anymore. You can no longer say simple things like “Praise God!” without someone responding with a comment that says something like “There is no God you idiot. God is for dumb people and you are the epitome of stupidity. Take your God comments and go somewhere else.” You are no longer allowed to agree with a political view such as “Repeal the Obama Healthcare law.” without someone saying very bluntly “You are a racist for not wanting the law. You suck and I hope you die!”. And don’t even bother trying to comment about gun control or abortion, positive or negative. Forget about making comments on someone’s world-view, philosophy, trying to comment on truth, fact or fiction, or anything meaningful for that matter. Facebook is now a rant-fest and it is incredibly depressing. It has become a rally point for those looking for some type of acceptance. Most of these people will say and do anything to get attention, or to get someone to follow and\\\\or agree to their point of view.\\n\\nRespect or etiquette on Facebook has long been stripped from most contributor comments. I have found that the uneducated and uninformed let their true colors come out on Facebook more than anyone else. In their mind no one is entitled to an opinion because “I am right and you are wrong and that’s the way it is.” Dissention is not allowed and debating a viewpoint is no longer welcome. I believe that this has to do with the way our society now behaves in general which has trickled down into the social networks (or have come from the social networks for that matter). Social networks have empowered people to say and do what they want, how they want, whenever they want, and to whomever they want to say it to without the fear of any consequences. Because “hey, this is the internet right? And the internet is freedom of speech right?”… People have come to believe that they no longer have to account for their own actions, beliefs, or comments anymore – especially on social networks. This is drama that I simply do not need to be a part of, nor support.\\n\\nThe last reason of why I closed my Facebook account is this realization about “social networks” in general. We are becoming a society of disconnectedness. Somehow we have come to believe that having a smartphone, watching CNN or FoxNews on cable TV, having multiple email accounts, tweeting the latest news, having the largest amount of ‘friends’ on social networks, and knowing the latest and greatest up-to-date information from social networks makes us more connected than ever. But it is a lie. The more you focus on keeping your social network status up to date the more you will become personally disconnected from your family and peers and, in effect, forces your mind to become shut off from the world. This is what leads to depression, addiction, and loneliness. Do you now see what _information overload_ does? Don’t take my word for it, [look up the various articles and studies yourself](http://www.google.com/#q=effects+of+facebook)\\n\\nSo what now?\\n\\nI don’t see opinionated comments anymore, unsettling pictures, or people trolling through some of my old posts and revisiting things (stuff from the past) that I don’t need to talk about anymore. After closing my Facebook account, I can say that I am a happier man. I am spending more time with my family and I am actually having more face to face conversations. I am on the phone talking with my parents and friends instead of typing quick little comments on their Facebook Wall\\\\Timeline. I don’t worry any more about what someone may have said, or might say. And you know what? I don’t miss Facebook. Not one bit.\\n\\nFacebook is the first social network that I have completely severed my ties with. If my Twitter profile ever gets to the extreme like I had with Facebook, I will probably abandon that as well, and then Google+ if that gets out of hand, and then LinkedIn, and so on. I do wish Facebook and everyone on the social network well. But I have chosen to no longer be victim to the drama that plagues Facebook Timelines…\\n\\nNow, this is only my opinion and may be more of a problem with our society in general. But nonetheless, Facebook members are composed of the people in our society. In effect, our society makes Facebook what it is.\\n\\n- Joe\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><em><font color=\"#000000\"><strong>“Well everyone it has been a good friend while it lasted but I am finally saying goodbye to Facebook, forever.

Some of the things I posted were important, but most were not.</p>\n<p>Facebook had been a part of my life, as well as my entire family's life, for almost five years. It used to be a great place to share. It was clean, simple, and easy to use. But like our society, Facebook has evolved and transformed into an ugly and vile place – which is something that I think Facebook was never originally intended to be. To me, Facebook was supposed to be a safe place to connect with friends and peers that only you want to allow into your “circle of trust” [gratuitous ‘Meet the Parents’ reference]. But over the years, the circle of trust idea has exploded into something that I can barely explain. I can’t blame Zuck and his dev teams for what has happened to this amazing social system. Facebook members are what makes Facebook the type of experience it is today. Facebook is a free ecosystem - It is only as good as the people that support it which are its members. And a majority of people no longer make it an enjoyable place to spend my time. The reasons of why I closed my account are many, but there are three primary reasons why I closed my account.</p>\n<p>The idea of closing my Facebook account came about during the 2012 American political election season. During the debates, the internet was rife with various opinions and ideas, and so was Facebook. I came to expect certain things to be said about each side. But this election cycle’s comments and actions by far seemed to be the most… bold… compared to what I have experienced in the past. I kept fairly quiet during the entire election cycle having only a single comment about the final Presidential Debate in October which, to my delight, did not spark any controversy. I had quietly viewed some of my family and friends’ profiles without leaving comments but decided to stop posting anything. After the elections were over, I rarely logged into my account, but I did update with short and simple comments whenever I logged in. It wasn’t until after the Sandy Hook shootings that I finally decided to close my account.</p>\n<p>The main reason why I closed my account is that it is impossible to have an intelligent conversation with anyone on Facebook anymore. You can no longer say simple things like “Praise God!” without someone responding with a comment that says something like “There is no God you idiot. God is for dumb people and you are the epitome of stupidity. Take your God comments and go somewhere else.” You are no longer allowed to agree with a political view such as “Repeal the Obama Healthcare law.” without someone saying very bluntly “You are a racist for not wanting the law. You suck and I hope you die!”. And don’t even bother trying to comment about gun control or abortion, positive or negative. Forget about making comments on someone’s world-view, philosophy, trying to comment on truth, fact or fiction, or anything meaningful for that matter.

But it is a lie. The more you focus on keeping your social network status up to date the more you will become personally disconnected from your family and peers and, in effect, forces your mind to become shut off from the world.

These\nare more or less some notes I jotted down while setting up DA2012 for a\ncustomer.\n\nNote #1:\n\nThe following case occurred both with my customer’s DirectAccess 2012 server, as\nwell as my home test lab. Both environments have a fresh Windows Server 2012\nDatacenter installation and a brand new Windows Server 2012 Domain Controller\n(in Win2012 forest and domain levels) running in Hyper-V. DirectAccess was\nenabled using the basic single-NIC DirectAccess deployment method.\n\nOpening the RemoteAccess console and looking at the Operations Status, all of\nthe DA services are running and show a green check mark, but to the right an\nerror is displayed, “Configuration for server cannot be retrieved from the\nDomain Controller”.\n\n \n[http://lh6.ggpht.com/-h2rgtjUYhvM/UMAS25hCwiI/AAAAAAAABqQ/8oq0VDtVF84/s1600-h/image%25255B3%25255D.png]\n\nPerforming a gpresult from an elevated command line showed the root cause right\naway:\n\n \n[http://lh3.ggpht.com/-0zDS_SAl97I/UMAS4GZ-o8I/AAAAAAAABqg/saJRgwLJhiY/s1600-h/image%25255B7%25255D.png]\n\nGroup Policy was filtering out my DA server from the GPO object for some reason.\nTo fix, I opened up Group Policy Management on the domain controller and made\nsure that my DA server was a part of the group.\n\nNote #2:\n\nOpen the Remote Access Console on your DA server. Click on “Configuration” in\nthe left pane, then click on the edit button under Step #2.

Each public computer has a very large Windows 7 \\\"image\\\" deployed to it (around 100gb) that has a great deal of embedded software which includes Faronics DeepFreeze to prevent any type of system changes. Each of these computers are used by our customers every single day. From cold boot to CTRL+ALT+DEL the PC would take around 2 minutes then from the login screen to a fully usable desktop it would take at least 5 to 6 minutes. Adding these numbers up means that it would literally take around 8 minutes for a user to log into a computer and be able to actually use it to do work. You can imagine how angry our customers felt having to wait around 10 minutes just to use a computer! \\n\\nFirst we need to ask the question, \\\"What exactly is an acceptable amount of time it should take for a user to log in to a computer and work?\\\" 8 minutes is not acceptable by any imagination. To get straight to the point and without getting into a philosophical discussion, between 2 - 4 minutes is a very acceptable boot time for a computer regardless of the type of hardware it has in it. \\n\\nIn order to troubleshoot this issue and fix the problem, we used several Sysinternals tools (Process Monitor and Autoruns) to see what was going launching at startup and to view what processes were running during boot and winlogon.

We disabled DeepFreeze then installed the Windows Performance Toolkit on it. The toolkit includes two specific tools, the Windows Performance Recorder and the Windows Performance Analyzer.

After reading this article\n[http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-FBGXHZ/index.html?solution=1-FBGXHZ]\n\n \n[http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ELZnd3rLTC0/UKRscjUorBI/AAAAAAAABic/xRZ2OSxZ6QQ/s1600-h/image%25255B20%25255D.png]\n\nWe looked at the services that started up with the computer as well and only one\nstood out as particularly important, the MS SQL Server service. The full\nMicrosoft Visual Studio 2010 Express suite is installed on these computers,\nwhich included SQL Server 2008 R2 Express. MS Visual Studio isn’t used by all\nusers on these computers, so we recommended to change the startup setting from\nautomatic to manual.\n\n \n[http://lh3.ggpht.com/-qGDTyAXV9H0/UKRseNbKLOI/AAAAAAAABis/pTJEP-TOg40/s1600-h/image%25255B16%25255D.png]\n\nSo, using the findings from the boot trace as a guide our Senior Support Tech\nand Desktop team went to work and started cleaning up the default user profile,\nchanges some Windows services from “Automatic” to “Manual”, cleaned up the task\nscheduler, edited the update schedule for our antivirus to during maintenance\nhours (so DeepFreeze would allow the changes to commit), and more. In the mean\ntime, our server team reviewed group policies and removed all old and redundant\npolicies that was causing additional slow down during boot and Windows logon.\n\nBy the time we tested the changes and pushed the changes to all of the affected\ncomputers, the boot and logon time went down from 8 to 10 minutes to 1.5 to 3\nminutes! And this is only for the very first logon of the day. As long as the\ncomputer was not turned off at any point, subsequent user logins took no longer\nthan 30 seconds each!\n\nResolving this issue truly was a team effort. A great deal of blood, sweat, and\ntears went into fixing our boot and logon performance issues and our customers\nare now much happier. During this process, we learned how to accurately\ntroubleshoot boot performance issues as well as how to avoid them in the future.\n\nThis article is only one example of how to use the Windows Performance Toolkit\nto create a trace for finding performance issues on a Windows computer. The\nexample above displays using these tools in Windows 7, but they also work in\nWindows 8. Below is a list of resources if you want to learn more about how to\nuse the WPT. I highly recommend you watch the TechNet 2012 video “How many\ncoffees can you drink while Windows boots?”\n[http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2012/WCL305]\n\nhttp://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2012/WCL305\n\n * Joe","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2012-11-15T04:15:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2012-11-15T04:15:56.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2012-11-15T04:15:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc797","uuid":"60d694ff-abb2-4caa-a7c0-c827f4ec2fb5","title":"A List of How-To’s for Windows 8 on the Spiceworks Community","slug":"a_list_of_how_to_s_for_windows_8_on_the_spiceworks_community","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Now that Windows 8 has been officially released, there are plenty of how-to articles on the[![image](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-tjw3giE7ioc/UJA-UJFK0RI/AAAAAAAABhA/Yka8ZSucEV8/image_thumb%25255B3%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-zycr_yJG3rE/UJA-TtfuoFI/AAAAAAAABg4/wdUsG5gsu4g/s1600-h/image%25255B12%25255D.png)\\n\\n* Accessing “God Mode”\\n* Using Windows 8 on a non-touch device\\n* Shortcuts and Hot-Keys\\n* System Management Tools built into Windows 8 (for IT Pros)\\n* and more\\n\\n[http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/270677-complete-listing-of-windows-8-how-to-s](http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/270677-complete-listing-of-windows-8-how-to-s)\\n\\nIf you are not familiar with Spiceworks, it is a company based in Austin, TX that makes IT management software of the same name.

We use two different Windows deployment types depending on where the ![](http://yaprocmon.sourceforge.net/Images/icon.png)computer is going. There is one very large specialty “image” (100gb in size) and one smaller “image” (15gb) for the general staff. The large image has a great deal of large software installs embedded in the image, while the smaller image is a standard one that include Microsoft Office, Adobe Reader, and other similar core apps that one may need. One special note about the larger deployment type is that it has Faronics DeepFreeze installed on it to prevent system changes. \\nWhen these computers started getting deployed on our network, a strange issue was happening. When a user would log in with their domain credentials on a PC with the 100GB image, it would literally take anywhere from 7-15 minutes for the desktop to go from logon screen to desktop view. We knew that the computer was not frozen at the “Welcome” screen after logging in because the please wait circle icon was rotating. All the user had to do was sit and wait around 10 minutes (or longer) until the computer displayed the desktop. This issue did not occur on computers with the standard deployment image. \\n\\nIn the beginning (when this issue really started), I pretty much knew where to start looking to resolve the problem. I remembered a TechEd 2010 video called \\\"\\\" by Mark Russinovich, and I remembered reading some of his . I emailed some of this information to the support personnel to inform them that since no one could find the root cause, I recommended to take a look at Mark's blog posts for guidance. A few weeks went by and I never heard anything about it. But after a short while, the issue exploded and the “blame game” started up. One person would claim, “The network is the problem!”, or “The servers are the problem!”, or “The deployment image is the problem!”. Some people started clamoring, “Give me back my old Windows XP computer. I didn’t have a problem until I got this Windows 7 PC!”. We’ve all heard that one at some point in time haven’t we? (cough, Vista)… Anywhoo, lets move on. \\n\\nNow, this issue had been going on for a few months but it wasn't a big deal until now. Some of the company \\\"higher-ups\\\" contacted our I.T. Directors and demanded that the problem be fixed NOW. One of the I.T. directors asked for network team, security team, and the server team’s assistance in finding out what the heck was going on. In the beginning it made sense to bring in all of these people resources because more and more Windows 7 computers were being deployed and this was now a widespread issue. \\n\\nEach team (Desktop support, Server, Network, Security) worked together trying to locate the root cause. We checked the Event Viewer, we ran Wireshark traces to see if the problem was network related, we re-checked the image settings, the security team checked over the computers believing it could be a worm or virus causing the problem, we even re-built the deployment images because we weren’t sure of what the root cause was. To our surprise, the Wireshark captures and Windows Event viewer showed nothing strange. The image settings were the same as the smaller image and the problem came back even after rebuilding the large image. There were no viruses or worms detected. Did we disable IPv6? You bet we did. Did that fix the problem? Nope. In the end, the problem largely eluded us. \\n\\nI was working on another critical project at the time research of this problem began. Since others were already putting in time on the problem, I stayed on the sidelines. But it was “all hands on deck” to resolve this issue and everyone was looking for help to get this problem fixed. Before long, my supervisor asked me to take a quick look at the problem since I may be able to help. I took a step back and looked at exactly what was going on. In general, the problem was very common. For some reason the computer was taking forever to finish the logon process. After a user logs into the computer using their domain credentials the \\\"Welcome\\\" screen would display with the rotating circle and stay in that mode for 5 to 10 minutes before the desktop would finally display. Using Mark's blog post \\\"\\\" as a guide, I turned to Process Monitor to start troubleshooting the problem. After I logged into on of the affected PCs, I copied PROCMON to the desktop of the PC, ran it, and enabled the boot logging option. \\n\\nI wanted to capture all processes and events both during boot and after logging in, so I checked the box to generate profiling events every second. \\n\\nAfter choosing this option, I immediately rebooted the computer. I logged back in (waiting the 5-10 minutes for the desktop to display), then launched Process Monitor and chose to save the boot logs immediately to the desktop. To my surprise, the boot logs were spread over four files and totaled over 1.3GB in size! Double-clicking on one of them opened up the entire log and displayed over 3 million events. \\n\\nI needed a starting point. For that, I used Mark's blog as a reference. I cut straight to the chase and opened the Process Tree by clicking <u>Options >> Process Tree</u>. \\n\\nThe Process Tree shows every process that ran, was running, or opened at some point, during a logged trace. Starting from the bottom of the list I started looking at WinLogon.exe. The only thing that really stood out was the Citrix Receiver application. This entire process monitor trace starts at 3:57pm and ends at 4:05pm. The Citrix Receiver app started at 3:59 and ended at 4:02, taking 3 minutes to execute. \\n\\nAnother clue was the dark green bar under the Life Time column. Dark green indicates how long the process took to complete within this boot trace timeline. Anything light green indicates that the process never stopped during the trace (which is usually an internal Windows process or service). However, I was very skeptical that this was the culprit because looking at the sub-processes the Receiver app itself launches and runs in the system tray at all times. Plus, I hadn't heard of the Citrix Receiver causing boot problems before. So from the bottom of the Process Tree working my way up, I started looking at all of the processes one-by-one. Half-way up the list four very distinct dark green bars which were stacked on top of each other, in order, immediately caught my attention. \\n\\nTwo WScript processes were running side-by-side. But one of them called an application called FRAMEPKG.EXE. WScript is the Windows Script Host process that runs the domain VBscript login scripts on this computer. Yes, this computer is a member of a domain and in this domain we run login scripts. After one of the WScript process started, it launched FRAMEPKG.EXE, and under that executed FRMINST.EXE, which invokes Windows Installer (MSIEXEC.EXE). Framepkg.exe is digitally signed by McAfee as shown in the display grid. After doing a web search, I found that it is a part of the McAfee Antivirus Enterprise product. It was clear that a re-installation of the McAfee Framework package was occurring during a logon session. Scrolling to the right confirmed by suspicion that it was highly possible that this was the root cause because the process started at 3:58 and didn't finish until after 4:02pm, more than 4 minutes. Not only that, looking under the Commands column confirmed that the Framework package was indeed kicking off a re-installation thanks to the \\\"/ForceInstall\\\" switch leaving little to the imagination. \\n\\nHighlighting the FRAMEPKG.EXE process showed more information about how\\\\why it was launched at the bottom of the window. \\n\\nSo, a login script is kicking off the installation of the McAfee Framework package for McAfee Antivirus Enterprise after each user logon. But there is one more gotcha with this instance…. If you remember from the beginning of this article, Faronics DeepFreeze is installed on these computers to prevent system changes and these computers do not have any domain user profiles stored on them.... Are you starting to see the problem here? A program installation is running side-by-side with the user profile creation process (that copies data from the Default User profile). The hard disk I\\\\O is off the charts and is incredibly intensive with this going on... \\n\\nHere is a rough rundown of exactly what was happening after these PCs boot up: \\n\\n* PC boots.\\n* Faronics DeepFreeze driver loads, freezing system changes.\\n* Login screen appears.\\n* User enters domain login credentials to log in.\\n* The Welcome splash screen appears with the rotating circle, not yet displaying the desktop.\\n* Login scripts run in the background, with one of them forcing the re-installation of the McAfee Framework package.\\n* The McAfee Framework package first removes the existing installation of the Framework package, then installs it all over again.\\n* While the McAfee installation is running, the user's profile is built for the first time further impacting disk I\\\\O.\\n* Only after the installation finishes and the user's profile is built, the desktop finally displays and the PC operates normally.\\n* When the PC reboots, any system changes are wiped out.\\n* Wash, rinse, repeat.\\n\\nI was fairly confident that I found the culprit. The question \\\"Why is this login script launching an Antivirus installation package after a user logs into the computer, every time a user logs in after the PC has been rebooted?\\\" couldn't be answered by me. For that, I needed to query the server admin team. I sent an email to our server admins and included these findings and asked them why the login script is forcing the installation of the McAfee software after every login. I also provided proof that this was happening by showing them the Process Monitor logs. The server admins were very surprised to hear that this script was still active because it was removed from the domain a few months before we started rolling out Windows 7\\\\. After a quick look at the GPOs, that McAfee login script was still active in one of the OUs where the PCs with the 100GB Windows 7 deployment image reside. After removing the GPO culprit, the slow login issues on these computers simply went away. \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThis problem had been going on for several months and Process Monitor helped us to resolve the problem within just a few hours. Through this story, you can see just how powerful Process Monitor is. What I learned throughout this event is how important proper troubleshooting of the Windows Desktop really is. Unless you are absolutely sure, don’t start placing blame elsewhere if you cannot figure out a problem. If you are having a problem on a Windows desktop OS, then start troubleshooting on the Windows desktop OS itself and branch out from there. For me, this is elementary. But for others, it may be a challenge. One way or another, locating evidence that leads to the solution starts where the issue was found. It is up to you to find it. Troubleshooting the Windows desktop is like crime scene investigations and forensics; If you dig deep enough, you will find the culprit. \\n\\nThere isn't much more to say here in this article other than to praise Mark Russinovich and Bryce Cogswell, as well as their Sysinternals colleagues, for creating these tools because without them I guarantee that we would still be working on trying to resolve the issue, or contacting Microsoft support services. This is only but one example of why it is important to use the correct tools to troubleshoot a problem. I will close out this article with the following quote from Mark Russinovich himself... \\n\\n\\\"When you take the approach of restart the app or restart the operating system or even re-install an operating system and start from scratch and hope that the problem doesn't happen again, you haven't learned anything, you don't know what caused the problem, you don't know how severe the problem is, or if the problem is going to come back and bite you again.

The image settings were the same as\nthe smaller image and the problem came back even after rebuilding the large\nimage. There were no viruses or worms detected. Did we disable IPv6? You bet we\ndid. Did that fix the problem? Nope. In the end, the problem largely eluded us.\n\nI was working on another critical project at the time research of this problem\nbegan. Since others were already putting in time on the problem, I stayed on the\nsidelines. But it was “all hands on deck” to resolve this issue and everyone was\nlooking for help to get this problem fixed. Before long, my supervisor asked me\nto take a quick look at the problem since I may be able to help. I took a step\nback and looked at exactly what was going on. In general, the problem was very\ncommon. For some reason the computer was taking forever to finish the logon\nprocess. After a user logs into the computer using their domain credentials the\n\"Welcome\" screen would display with the rotating circle and stay in that mode\nfor 5 to 10 minutes before the desktop would finally display. Using Mark's blog\npost \"\" as a guide, I turned to Process Monitor to start troubleshooting the\nproblem. After I logged into on of the affected PCs, I copied PROCMON to the\ndesktop of the PC, ran it, and enabled the boot logging option.\n\nI wanted to capture all processes and events both during boot and after logging\nin, so I checked the box to generate profiling events every second.\n\nAfter choosing this option, I immediately rebooted the computer. I logged back\nin (waiting the 5-10 minutes for the desktop to display), then launched Process\nMonitor and chose to save the boot logs immediately to the desktop. To my\nsurprise, the boot logs were spread over four files and totaled over 1.3GB in\nsize! Double-clicking on one of them opened up the entire log and displayed over\n3 million events.\n\nI needed a starting point. For that, I used Mark's blog as a reference. I cut\nstraight to the chase and opened the Process Tree by clicking Options >> Process\nTree.\n\nThe Process Tree shows every process that ran, was running, or opened at some\npoint, during a logged trace. Starting from the bottom of the list I started\nlooking at WinLogon.exe. The only thing that really stood out was the Citrix\nReceiver application. This entire process monitor trace starts at 3:57pm and\nends at 4:05pm. The Citrix Receiver app started at 3:59 and ended at 4:02,\ntaking 3 minutes to execute.\n\nAnother clue was the dark green bar under the Life Time column. Dark green\nindicates how long the process took to complete within this boot trace timeline.\nAnything light green indicates that the process never stopped during the trace\n(which is usually an internal Windows process or service). However, I was very\nskeptical that this was the culprit because looking at the sub-processes the\nReceiver app itself launches and runs in the system tray at all times. Plus, I\nhadn't heard of the Citrix Receiver causing boot problems before. So from the\nbottom of the Process Tree working my way up, I started looking at all of the\nprocesses one-by-one. Half-way up the list four very distinct dark green bars\nwhich were stacked on top of each other, in order, immediately caught my\nattention.\n\nTwo WScript processes were running side-by-side. But one of them called an\napplication called FRAMEPKG.EXE. WScript is the Windows Script Host process that\nruns the domain VBscript login scripts on this computer. Yes, this computer is a\nmember of a domain and in this domain we run login scripts. After one of the\nWScript process started, it launched FRAMEPKG.EXE, and under that executed\nFRMINST.EXE, which invokes Windows Installer (MSIEXEC.EXE). Framepkg.exe is\ndigitally signed by McAfee as shown in the display grid. After doing a web\nsearch, I found that it is a part of the McAfee Antivirus Enterprise product. It\nwas clear that a re-installation of the McAfee Framework package was occurring\nduring a logon session. Scrolling to the right confirmed by suspicion that it\nwas highly possible that this was the root cause because the process started at\n3:58 and didn't finish until after 4:02pm, more than 4 minutes. Not only that,\nlooking under the Commands column confirmed that the Framework package was\nindeed kicking off a re-installation thanks to the \"/ForceInstall\" switch\nleaving little to the imagination.\n\nHighlighting the FRAMEPKG.EXE process showed more information about how\\why it\nwas launched at the bottom of the window.\n\nSo, a login script is kicking off the installation of the McAfee Framework\npackage for McAfee Antivirus Enterprise after each user logon. But there is one\nmore gotcha with this instance…. If you remember from the beginning of this\narticle, Faronics DeepFreeze is installed on these computers to prevent system\nchanges and these computers do not have any domain user profiles stored on\nthem.... Are you starting to see the problem here? A program installation is\nrunning side-by-side with the user profile creation process (that copies data\nfrom the Default User profile). The hard disk I\\O is off the charts and is\nincredibly intensive with this going on...\n\nHere is a rough rundown of exactly what was happening after these PCs boot up:\n\n * PC boots.\n * Faronics DeepFreeze driver loads, freezing system changes.\n * Login screen appears.\n * User enters domain login credentials to log in.\n * The Welcome splash screen appears with the rotating circle, not yet\n   displaying the desktop.\n * Login scripts run in the background, with one of them forcing the\n   re-installation of the McAfee Framework package.\n * The McAfee Framework package first removes the existing installation of the\n   Framework package, then installs it all over again.\n * While the McAfee installation is running, the user's profile is built for the\n   first time further impacting disk I\\O.\n * Only after the installation finishes and the user's profile is built, the\n   desktop finally displays and the PC operates normally.\n * When the PC reboots, any system changes are wiped out.\n * Wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nI was fairly confident that I found the culprit. The question \"Why is this login\nscript launching an Antivirus installation package after a user logs into the\ncomputer, every time a user logs in after the PC has been rebooted?\" couldn't be\nanswered by me. For that, I needed to query the server admin team. I sent an\nemail to our server admins and included these findings and asked them why the\nlogin script is forcing the installation of the McAfee software after every\nlogin. I also provided proof that this was happening by showing them the Process\nMonitor logs. The server admins were very surprised to hear that this script was\nstill active because it was removed from the domain a few months before we\nstarted rolling out Windows 7. After a quick look at the GPOs, that McAfee login\nscript was still active in one of the OUs where the PCs with the 100GB Windows 7\ndeployment image reside. After removing the GPO culprit, the slow login issues\non these computers simply went away.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis problem had been going on for several months and Process Monitor helped us\nto resolve the problem within just a few hours. Through this story, you can see\njust how powerful Process Monitor is. What I learned throughout this event is\nhow important proper troubleshooting of the Windows Desktop really is. Unless\nyou are absolutely sure, don’t start placing blame elsewhere if you cannot\nfigure out a problem. If you are having a problem on a Windows desktop OS, then\nstart troubleshooting on the Windows desktop OS itself and branch out from\nthere. For me, this is elementary. But for others, it may be a challenge. One\nway or another, locating evidence that leads to the solution starts where the\nissue was found. It is up to you to find it. Troubleshooting the Windows desktop\nis like crime scene investigations and forensics; If you dig deep enough, you\nwill find the culprit.\n\nThere isn't much more to say here in this article other than to praise Mark\nRussinovich and Bryce Cogswell, as well as their Sysinternals colleagues, for\ncreating these tools because without them I guarantee that we would still be\nworking on trying to resolve the issue, or contacting Microsoft support\nservices. This is only but one example of why it is important to use the correct\ntools to troubleshoot a problem. I will close out this article with the\nfollowing quote from Mark Russinovich himself...\n\n\"When you take the approach of restart the app or restart the operating system\nor even re-install an operating system and start from scratch and hope that the\nproblem doesn't happen again, you haven't learned anything, you don't know what\ncaused the problem, you don't know how severe the problem is, or if the problem\nis going to come back and bite you again. It is worth spending even just a few\nminutes to go try to figure out what's happened. Often times, that will lead you\nto a solution.\" - Mark Russinovich, TechEd 2010 Session \"\"\n\nThe Case of the Unexplained, 2010: Troubleshooting with Mark Russinovich\n[http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2010/WCL315]","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2012-10-13T03:45:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2012-10-17T15:54:40.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2012-10-13T03:45:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc79a","uuid":"fdba32a7-0775-4a5d-bcba-28864fa507b4","title":"RightFax 9.4 error, “The fax server could not find an account matching your network login”","slug":"right_fax_9_4_error_the_fax_server_could_not_find_an_account_matching_your_network_login","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Here is the scenario: You just finished installing RightFax on a Windows Server and launch the RightFax Enterprise Fax Manager tool from the Start Menu.

However, it is usually difficult to do this because in order to do networking training you usually need vast amounts of hardware. Thanks to virtualization, I can ramp up as many servers as the virtualization host can handle, set up a bunch of virtual switches and routers, and assign whatever I want to the physical NICs on the virtual host. \\n\\nOne of the things that I enjoy doing the most in my “free time” is building my own test labs and test networks. I have had a great deal of success doing this using various virtualization and software-based networking technologies. At the moment, I have one VMware ESXi 5.1 host with two virtual routers running Vyatta Network OS 6.4\\\\. So far the installation is rock solid and I haven’t had any issues aside from the NATting, which I will address in a minute… \\n\\nThe screenshot below is a visual representation of my current network environment at home. \\n[![Vyatta design](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-pVWt7rw0cGs/UGc-PhmXrUI/AAAAAAAABbo/cIojDYwIfJU/Vyatta-design_thumb1.png?imgmax=800 \\\"Vyatta design\\\")](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-WiifYifVl7Q/UGc-PP4YeOI/AAAAAAAABbg/abh7wPUASWs/s1600-h/Vyatta-design3.png) \\nFrom this diagram, you should be able to tell that all I did was connect my ESXi host to the simple switch. This was OK for a time, but my needs have expanded from this simple setup. The problem lies with the SOHO home WiFi router.

Every once in a while I am informed![](http://www.ganora.co.za/file/pdf.png) about a software title that impresses me enough that I make a change in my software habits; which leads me to today’s article!\\n\\nToday I am going to compare the classic, well known and well loved, PDF creation software called with a new title from the makers of PDF Converter Pro called [FreePDF Creator](http://www.pdfconverter.com/freepdfcreator/)\\n\\n**<font color=\\\"#f79646\\\" size=\\\"3\\\">CutePDF Writer Impressions:</font>**\\n\\nCutePDF Writer has a complete download size of 6.83mb. One file is the GPL Ghostscript writer, the other file is the actual CutePDF app.  So you need to install the Ghostscript writer first, then install CutePDF. The Ghostscript install is very fast and is almost silent. The CutePDF Writer installation is a straightforward one; click next to start, accept the license agreement, then click Install. In the past, the Ask Toolbar was bundled with the installer. But in today’s download it appears to have been removed, which is a good thing! After the installation finished, a web page pops up to a small readme about the software.\\n\\nUsing CutePDF is simple. Just print a document and choose the CutePDF Writer printer. The screenshot is from Microsoft Word 2010.\\n\\n[![image](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-XuS7rlNrQM4/UGIHPzLX6xI/AAAAAAAABZw/C_i88y_H2i4/image_thumb%25255B12%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-5LOa5lJEASM/UGIHPT6_rhI/AAAAAAAABZo/o1HIpjA9EPQ/s1600-h/image%25255B20%25255D.png)\\n\\nAfter printing the document, a small classic Windows 98 style “Save As” window appears. Choose a folder location to store the file and click Save to finish. All in all, this is a pretty straght-forward process.\\n\\nSo that is pretty much it for CutePDF Writer. There isn’t much to it, which is why it is loved by so many! It is simple to use and doesn’t eat up system resources.\\n\\n**<font color=\\\"#f79646\\\" size=\\\"3\\\">FreePDF Creator Impressions:</font>**\\n\\nFreePDF Creator installer has a file size of 11.8mb and is a single file download, already making it easier to install for non-technical users.\\n\\nThe FreePDF Creator installation process is fairly straightforward.

So I figure why not write one of my own articles? This post is all about one specific problem my colleagues and I had with VLAN tagging on an MX80 and MS22 switch. Thanks to help from Meraki customer support, everything is back up and running as expected. \\n\\nWe are using a single MX80 router that has two VLANs configured, VLAN10 with subnet 192.168.10.0/24 and VLAN20 with subnet 192.168.20.0/24\\\\. All untagged traffic was assumed to be on VLAN20\\\\. This means if the network traffic is not tagged on the switch, then the router will move the traffic to VLAN20\\\\. DHCP is running on the MX80 and is configured to dish out IP addresses to each subnet accordingly. Connected to the MX80 router is one MS22 switch, with one trunk port allowing all VLANs. The first half of the ports on the MS22 switch is tagging traffic for VLAN10 with the second half of the switch ports tagging for VLAN20. \\n\\nFor some reason, when connecting a host to the VLAN10 switch ports, the MX80 was ignoring the VLAN tagging and assigning an DHCP address to the host from the VLAN20 scope - breaking our security model for this network. Any traffic tagged on VLAN10 should be assigned a DHCP IP address on the VLAN10 subnet correct? Well, not exactly. The problem was due to two things: \\n1) The MX80 was configured to put untagged traffic on VLAN20. \\n2) The Management VLAN on the MS22 was still set for VLAN 1. \\n\\nIn order to fix this, the solution was simple - change the management VLAN on the MS22 to VLAN 20. \\nA more secure option was to configure the following: \\n\\n1. Configure a static IP address on the MS22 switch. (This must be the first step!)\\n2. Configure the Management VLAN on the MS22 switch to VLAN 1.\\n3.

For those that require the Cisco Agent (for their Cisco desk phones), you can use this same process for installing the software on your own Windows 7 or Windows 8 computer. Just keep in mind that installing software on un-supported OSes could be a violation of your license or support agreements.\\n\\nSo you may be asking, “How\\\\why does this work?” Using the application compatibility infrastructure built into the Windows OS, a “shim” is applied to the application file when it is executed. In this case, we shimmed the application to force it to _think_ that it is running on a Windows 7 computer.\\n\\nYou would be surprised as just how many desktop application issues are resolved by using shims.

F5 assumes that you are already familiar with various SSL certificate types, the certificate issue process, and how to convert certificates to different formats. Now to be fair, if you are going to be administering an F5 you should already know this information. But since I wasn't well versed in SSL certificates before I started getting acquainted with a BIG-IP appliance, I am going to address those issues here.\\n\\n_**Understanding SSL Certificates**_\\n\\nAn SSL certificate is actually two pieces, a certificate and its private key. When an SSL certificate is 'digitally signed', this means that the private key and the cert itself are paired together. When you need an SSL certificate, you first create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and upload it to a Certificate Authority (CA) such as Verisign or GoDaddy. After you pay the CA to authorize the request, the CA then digitally signs the request with a private key and sends it back to you. This certificate can then be converted to different file formats depending on your needs, and/or directly imported to your server(s) or network appliance(s). SSL Certificates are purchased in 1, 2, or 3 year increments.\\n\\nF5 supports _Self-Signed_ SSL certificates as well as _Root Certificates_. The only difference between the two is that self-signed certificates are generated by, well, you. Root certificates are authorized by a high-level entity which, in essence, are more secure. One reason why you pay a high-level entity like Verisign for an SSL certificate is for the privilege of claiming that your website has been 'verified' to be secure. There are many more reasons why you would want to do this, but know that both cert types encrypt IP traffic between hosts and servers.\\n\\nThere are several certificate file types that you need to be aware of regarding F5 appliances:\\n\\n* PKCS#12 - This is a certificate with a .pfx extension. The certificate and private key are in the same file, but importing the certificate requires a password. The password would have been provided to you from the certificate authority (CA), or certificate issuer such as Verisign.\\n* PKCS#7  - This is a certificate chain with both the cert and the private key embedded and encrypted inside. This file has a .p7b extension. Since the cert key is already embedded and encrypted in the cert file, typing a password to activate the certificate is not required.\\n* PEM (X.509) - Importing an SSL certificate requires that certificate to be in .PEM or X.509 format. This is especially true for F5 devices. However, PKCS#12 certificates in PEM format need to be split into CRT and KEY files. PKCS#7 certificates in PEM format do not require the file to be split.\\n* CRT - The certificate portion of a PKCS#12 PEM file.\\n* KEY - The private key portion of a PKCS#12 PEM file.\\n\\n**_Converting SSL Certificates for F5 BIG-IP Appliances_**\\n\\nYou use F5's TMSH tool to convert SSL certificates. TMSH is accessed simply by connecting to the F5 appliance via SSH using an account with administrative access, then executing \\\"TMSH\\\" at the command line. First, upload the certificate file to the F5's file system, then navigate to the location of it in the file system. If the certificate is an PKCS#12 certificate, then execute the following command:\\n\\n<font face=\\\"Consolas\\\">openssl pkcs12 -in <PKCSfile> -out <filename>.pem -nodes</font>\\n\\nIf the certificate is an PKCS#7 certificate, execute this command instead:\\n\\n<font face=\\\"Consolas\\\">openssl pkcs7 -in <PKCSfile>.p7b -text -out <filename>.pem -print_certs</font>\\n\\nAfter conversion, copy the newly created PEM file to your desktop. You can move on to the next section if you have a PKCS#7 cert. If you have a PKCS#12 PEM file you need to split it by performing the following steps:\\n\\n1. Open the PEM file with a text editor.\\n2. Copy/paste the BEGIN CERTIFICATE area into a new text file. Name the TXT file and change it's file extension to .CRT.\\n3. Copy/paste the BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY area into a new text file. Name this other TXT file and change it's file extention to .KEY.\\n\\n_**Updating the SSL certificate in the F5 BIG-IP GUI.**_\\n\\nNow that you have a copy of the PEM file, or the CRT and KEY files, you can update the certificate in the F5 appliance.\\n\\n_For PKCS#7 certificates:_\\n\\n1. Click **System** > **File** **Management** > **SSL Certificate List**.\\n2. Click on the Certificate name you need to update then click the **Import** button.\\n3. Click **Browse** and locate the PEM file on your desktop.\\n4. Click **Import**.Type the password of the certificate if prompted to do so.\\n5. Verify that the certificate expiration date changed.\\n\\n_For PKCS#12 certificates:_\\n\\n1. Click **System** > **File Management** > **SSL Certificate List**.\\n2. Click on the Certificate name you need to update then click the **Import** button.\\n3. Click **Browse** and locate the CRT file on your desktop.\\n4. Click **Import**.\\n5.

One of my first projects dealt with configuring our Cisco IOS switches to authenticate logins against our Active Directory accounts. This allows us to manage our network devices much easier, as well as helping to secure our devices by locking them down to actual user logins instead of relying on the local user databases for each device. Needless to say, it was NOT easy figuring out how to set up everything due to our infrastructure setup. Online documentation was incredibly confusing and led me in the wrong direction several times, but I was able to get everything working. \\n\\nThis article should really be titled “How to set up TACACS+ for Active Directory authentication with a Cisco Secure ACS 4.2 server” but hey, I only have so much to work with. Please keep in mind that this article assumes you already have knowledge about how to work with the Cisco IOS CLI, how to manage and handle user accounts in Windows Active Directory, that you have an ACS appliance connected to the network, and your IOS device is able to communicate with the ACS server. \\n\\nOne special thing about our infrastructure is that we are using a Cisco Secure ACS server as our TACACS+ authentication server. We could have used a basic Windows Server 2008 RADUIS server (or even change the ACS server mode to RADIUS), but since we already had the ACS server up and running and we are not using it for anything else, it made sense for us to only set it up for TACACS+. If you don’t have an ACS server and want to use a Windows RADIUS server instead, . \\n\\nSo, in starting this journey I had several pieces of equipment available: \\n\\n* 1x Cisco Secure ACS v4.2 appliance (hereby referred to as the ACS server)\\n* 1x Windows Server 2003 Server that is a member of a domain (a.k.a. member server)\\n* 1x Cisco Catalyst 3750X-48P Switch with IOS 12.2\\n\\nIf you have the same type of hardware or infrastructure setup as me, here is an extremely high level overview of exactly what I did to set up Active Directory authentication on the ACS server, TACACS+ configurations on the Cisco IOS switch, and setting up the Cisco Secure ACS Remote Agent software on the domain member server: \\n\\n1. Install and configure the Cisco Secure ACS Remote Agent software on the domain member server. Information on how to do this is [located on Cisco’s website here](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/secursw/ps5338/products_installation_and_configuration_guide_chapter09186a0080193aa0.html)\\n2. Add the Remote Agent under <u>Network Configuration</u> in the ACS server.\\n3. Set up Active Directory as an <u>External User Database</u> in the ACS server.\\n4. [Read Jose Leitao’s blog on how to do this here.](http://blog.initialdraft.com/archives/41/)\\n5. Set up user accounts in the ACS server for access to log into Cisco IOS devices.\\n6. Configure TACACS and AAA authentication on the Cisco IOS device.

I would complain about not receiving training, I would\nexpect to be a part of projects without question and if I wasn’t offered to be a\npart of one I would complain about it. I would also not be willing to share my\nknowledge and instead would simply expect others to show me what to do instead\nof figuring it out for myself and asking questions later.\nHow did I get to this point? How did I finally learn to want  to be a better\nperson? To be a better worker? To be a better person in this life?\nWell, I suppose I created a set of my own mental guidelines to follow not only\nat work, but in my personal and family life. In no particular order, here are\nthe 10:\n\n 1.  Never settle for status-quo. There is always a faster, easier, better way\n     to get the job done.\n 2.  Change is good if it is an improvement! Continual improvement is a lost\n     virtue – teach it, learn it, live it.\n 3.  Work now, play later.\n 4.  Share your knowledge and others will share theirs in return.\n 5.  Accept your mistakes. Learn from them and make yourself better.\n 6.  If you feel like you could have done more, then you should have done so in\n     the first place.\n 7.  Don’t complain about your job, ever. If it is not meant to be, it is time\n     to move on.\n 8.  Don’t complain about the tasks given to you by your supervisor, ever. There\n     is a reason why you are given the task.\n 9.  Be honest. Lies truly do not pay off in the end.\n 10. Be like Jesus and work as if you are working for God because He truly is\n     the best boss to work for!\n\n-Joe","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2012-05-01T02:01:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2012-05-01T02:02:55.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2012-05-01T02:01:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc7b8","uuid":"52f19b50-2c98-4741-a866-b15bb87e4e7b","title":"What is Full Hard Disk Encryption and why should I care about it?","slug":"what_is_full_hard_disk_encryption_and_why_should_i_care_about_it","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"In today’s article, I am not going to talk about passwords or backing up your data.![](http://static.arstechnica.net/bitlocker_drive_encryption.png) Instead, we are going to take a deep dive on one key security issue; and that issue is encryption.

Since I am the type of guy that likes to be on the 'up-and-up' with technology I decided to take the plunge and use Windows 8 exclusively at work and at home and see how things stack up. Like many of my other I.T. peers, I had a fantastic experience with the Windows 7 Public Beta a few years back so it is because of that experience on why I have decided to use Windows 8 ahead of it's official release. But of course, another motive to me using Windows 8 is to see if it really is what it is cracked up to be and maybe, just maybe, I would be the local expert at my place of work when Windows 8 is officially released. I did use the Windows 8 Developer Preview and, to be honest, I didn't see much reason for a business or consumer to actually upgrade to the new OS. But, I had already read several first impressions about the Consumer Preview and it looks like Microsoft is headed in the right direction. Will Windows 8 still do what I need it to do at my business? Does the new Metro UI interfere with the way that I use Windows on my desktop? And of course, will Windows 8 be worth the upgrade? Lets dive in an take a look... \\n\\nInstallation and Upgrade: \\n[![](http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/windows-8-metro-apps1.jpg)](http://www.joedissmeyer.com)\\n\\nThe Clean Install on the Laptop: \\nThe clean install acts and performs just like a clean install when booting from a USB drive or DVD of Windows Vista or Windows 7\\\\. However, installation was surprisingly faster. Normally, it can take up to an hour for me to perform a clean install of Windows Vista until it boots to the \\\"out-of-box-experience\\\" (OOBE) first time boot screen. In Windows 7, it takes about 20 to 30 minutes for the computer to boot to the OOBE. But with Windows 8, I was at OOBE and up and running after only 14 minutes from start to finish.\\n\\nThe Upgrade Install on my Desktop: \\nAfter booting up in the burned DVD of Windows 8 and running setup.exe, I was first prompted to reboot my PC to continue probably because I didn't reboot after installing some Windows Updates. After I rebooted and logged back in to the desktop, I had to manually kick off setup.exe again. I only had to answer 3 questions and the Windows 8 installer handled everything else. To my surprise, the upgrade was smooth and seamless. I have never, EVER, had a smooth and seamless upgrade from one operating system to another so I was baffled! The installation only took an hour and I didn't have to re-install ANY of my applications or restore ANY of my files from my backup external hard drive. This is definitely a big win for Microsoft in my opinion. Those that want to upgrade to Windows 8 from Windows Vista or Windows 7 will no longer have to worry about re-installing all of their apps and copying back their data from a backup drive to their computer after the upgrade completes. This is a very good thing for everyone.\\n\\nDevice Drivers: \\nWindows 8 uses the exact same driver model as Windows Vista or Windows 7\\\\. As long as there is a driver available for your computer in Vista or Windows 7, you can install the hardware. Windows does a good enough job with finding and installing missing device drivers through Windows Update, but there is still some hardware that isn't detected during installation. An example of this scenario is with my Dell Latitude D630 that had the nVidia Quadro NVS discrete graphics. When I installed Windows 8 on the D630, the ONLY drivers missing were the nVidia graphics drivers. I had to download and install the Windows Vista driver pack from Dell's support site and viola, I had full graphics performance. All other hardware was detected and installed during Windows 8 Setup. \\nSomething else worth noting is that it no longer takes 5 to 30 seconds to install a driver for a mouse or keyboard in Windows 8\\\\. Windows 8 is now just as fast as Mac OS X Lion when plugging in a USB mouse - it only takes a second or two for the device to register and work as normal! I tried this out with several standard wired USB mice, as well as my Microsoft Explorer Touch Mouse that uses the Microsoft Bluetrack (not Bluetooth) micro USB dongle. As soon as I plugged in that micro USB dongle, the mouse was fully usable after a second. \\nBut back to video drivers, I did notice one thing with Windows 8 where even though I didn't have the graphics driver installed, I still had Windows Aero effects enabled. Apparently, Microsoft has decided to allow software acceleration for Aero if a video driver is missing. Video performance was very poor until I installed the nVidia driver (which is to be expected)...\\n\\nPerformance: \\nAfter using Windows 8 for only a few minutes I immediately noticed drastic performance improvements. Basically, everything is _**faster**_. Now I don't mean that things seem fast just because a new OS is installed on the computer. I really do mean that things are faster, _**really fast**_. Loading desktop applications, transferring and copying files to\\\\from the hard drive, and playing games on Windows 8 is simply faster. I don't know if any of you downloaded and worked with the Windows 7 Public Betas a few years back, but I explicitly remember loading up Windows 7 Beta on a test PC and it was amazingly fast, much faster than even Windows 2000 on a decent, modern, computer. Even after Windows 7 was officially released, Windows 7 is was the speed champion as far as Windows OSes are concerned. But now it is my opinion that Windows 8 is faster than Windows 7\\\\. You can definitely tell that Microsoft is not playing around with Windows 8 and they are tweaking and fixing things, making the OS much faster than one would expect.\\n\\nMonitors - Dual Screens, Widescreen displays, and Standard displays: \\nI operate in a dual monitor environment on my work desktop. It is a Dell OptiPlex 780 with an ATI Radeon HD 4550 512mb dual head video card, 4GB of RAM, and a dual core Intel Core i5 processor. Both of my monitors are Dell 19 inch standard square monitors (not widescreen) with a maximum resolution of 1280x1024 per screen. The best feature regarding dual monitors is that Microsoft has finally spanned the toolbar across all monitor windows so I no longer have to install the Multimon 2.1 app on my deskop. Windows 8 also comes with a few very wide desktop backgrounds that span multiple monitors. My laptop has a 1440x900 widescreen display and I had the same experience.\\n\\nThe New Start - Welcome to Metro UI: \\nStart is the first thing you see when you boot up the computer and log into it for the first time. Here is one very important concept that you need to understand with Windows 8 - Start is Metro UI. I will say that again - _**<u>Start IS Metro UI</u>**_. Chances are that in the future, we will probably all begin to start referring to \\\"Start\\\" as \\\"Metro\\\" and use the terms interchangeably. So, expect to hear someone say, \\\"Go back to Metro\\\" and at the same time they mean \\\"Go back to Start\\\". The sooner you understand this concept the sooner you will find yourself immersed in the new design of Windows 8\\\\. I am willing to bet that the more you use Metro in Windows 8, you will find that the Metro design simply makes sense and I know that you will find that it is easier to use than the old Start Menus of previous versions of Windows. In my opinion, this is one more big win for Microsoft because every new user to Windows OS has to learn the old Start Menu concepts and it is not an easy thing to learn right off the bat. If you are using a tablet or touchscreen, you will be using Metro quite often. If you are using a laptop or desktop PC, you probably won't be using Start\\\\Metro as often as you think. It may seem intimidating at first, but if you are like me you will find that the new Start is very easy to understand and work with. So lets get started.... \\nAll operating system software from Microsoft and Apple is trending to make all applications, features, accessories, or any other type of launchable application appear as a modular \\\"app\\\" accessible from an app icon on your home view. This is much like an app on your iPhone or Android device. The Windows Desktop is no exception to this rule. So in Windows 8, when you want to go back to the desktop view, simply click on the Desktop \\\"app\\\" tile from Start. \\nIf you haven't noticed, there is no more \\\"Start Menu\\\" available from the desktop in Windows 8\\\\. There is no more Start Button on the task bar and there is no All Programs list. Instead, you must become accustomed to using the new Metro interface and the new \\\"Start\\\" is a part of that interface. Believe it or not, working with the new Start is much easier and much faster compared to the traditional Start Menu from the Windows OSes of old. To be honest, the new Start just makes sense. To get to Start, just move the mouse cursor to the very top or bottom left of the computer screen. A small thumbnail will appear. Click on it to go back to Start. Of course, you could also just hit the Windows key on your keyboard. \\nSearch is a BIG part of how to work with Start. If there is an application you want to run, just start typing while Start is displayed on screen. If there is an email that you want to read, or need to find some type of information in a document, just start typing what you are looking for while Start is onscreen. Once you try this just ONCE, you will be hooked. You just cannot screw this up. It's foolproof! Also notice that as you install applications, new app tiles appear in Start just like an application icon or folder would appear in All Programs in the Start Menu in Windows 7 or Windows XP. One would think that the new Start doesn't work well in the business world but I beg the differ. The old start menu in itself has been a problem ever since Windows NT and Windows 95\\\\. The old Start Menu is buggy and never worked perfectly, even in Windows 7\\\\. This new start in Metro UI is definitely a breath of fresh air and frankly, it just makes sense.\\n\\nThe Desktop: \\nYou will immediately notice that the desktop view looks almost identical to the Windows 7 desktop except that there is no more Start button (Start Orb) or Start Menu. In fact, EXPLORER.EXE is still the main part of the Windows Desktop experience and EXPLORER.EXE does run as soon as you start up the computer. If you are like me and don't have a tablet PC or touchscreen laptop, you will be working in desktop view most of the time that you use Windows 8\\\\. So for those that gripe about the new Start in Windows 8, I say \\\"Who cares!\\\". What I have done is pin my most commonly used applications to the taskbar in the Desktop View. Doing this allows me to stay in Desktop view 95% of the time that I use my Windows 8 computers. Any apps that I need to quickly use, I perform the Windows+R keyboard shortcut to open the Run box and execute a command, or quickly hit the Windows key on the keyboard, type the app or feature name, then hit enter to launch that computer.\\n\\nHotspots: \\nHotspots are the key to multitasking with Metro UI in Windows 8\\\\. Hotspots are the very top or bottom left corners of the display window. The bottom left gets you into Start, the top left is your app switcher much like hitting Alt+Tab on the keyboard however Alt-Tab only works on the desktop and the hotspot only works with Metro UI. If you have several Metro UI apps launched, such as the Windows Desktop and Remote Desktop, simply move the mouse cursor to the top left of the screen and wait a second for the first app thumbnail to display. Hover the cursor over the app for a moment, and a left sidebar will appear onscreen displaying all of the open Metro apps, including Start at the bottom. So now you know that you work with hotspots in Windows 8 when in either Desktop or Metro UI view and to get back to Start you work with hotspots. Move the mouse cursor to the very bottom left of the display and you will see a thumbnail of Start. Click on that thumbnail to return to Start. It's that simple.\\n\\nCharms: \\nCharms is something new in Windows 8 and are quick shortcuts to common tasks while inside of an app. It operates like hotspots, but instead of the left side of the screen Charms are on the right side. Charms are designed to mostly be used while inside of a Metro App, but can be used from the desktop view. They provide high level OS operations like go back to start, search, manage devices, or configure settings. I rarely use Charms in the Desktop view. But again, Charms are not really designed for desktop view anyways. Charms are designed to be used from Metro apps. I like that Microsoft moved Charms to the right of the primary monitor screen where the Show Desktop button in Windows 7 used to be. I never used the Show Desktop feature anyways and the Charm display is now out of my way. The only unfortunate thing in the new design is that the only way to Shut Down or Restart Windows 8 is from the Settings Charm. But, this is just another thing to get used to in Windows 8.\\n\\nKeyboard Shortcuts: \\nSince I work in IT, I am used to opening the Run box and launching the command line from the Start Menu in Windows 7\\\\. Since the Start Menu is now gone for good, I am being forced to learning the Windows shortcuts to launch the run box instead of clicking Start > Run. Of course, I could just open Start and type \\\"cmd\\\" to search, then launch the command line app. But hitting Windows+R on the keyboard is much, much, faster. Frankly, I am glad that Microsoft is forcing IT Professionals _actually_ learn how to become a keyboard junkie :)\\n\\nRemote Desktop: \\nRDC is a common application used to remotely connect to a server or desktop computer. Microsoft has provided a Metro app in Start called \\\"Remote Desktop\\\". This is the same app as the classic RDC client but it runs in full screen mode. Unfortunately, I have had issues with the RDC Metro App crashing, or not allowing me to exit from a current RDC connection even after I have logged out. But one good thing about the Remote Desktop Metro App is that it has built-in 'tabs'. The tabs allows you to be able to have multiple RDC connections open at once, then switch between them on demand within the app. Luckily, Microsoft has not taken out MSTSC.EXE from Windows 8\\\\. Naturally, I still prefer launching MSTSC.EXE from Run or the Command Line and if I need tabbed views, I still prefer Terminals.\\n\\nWindows Explorer: \\nThe Ribbon being built into Windows Explorer is definitely a breath of fresh air. No longer do I have to deal with trying to find the correct context menu options when I right-click on a file to perform some specific file maintenance tasks. Also, the ISO mounting ability is a nice addition. But Explorer is where Microsoft finally went back to fix some issues. For example, have you ever noticed how long it takes to copy and paste a file from one location to another in Windows Vista? The file would finish copying but Explorer would take a few extra seconds to finish the job and close the progress bar pop-up. This issue happens in Windows 7 too, but performance is a bit better than in Vista. Well, with Windows 8 Microsoft finally 'fixed' the problem and it no longer takes extra time to finish the file maintenance task.\\n\\nTask Manager: \\nThe old task manager from Windows 7 and before is just plain terrible. I have been using the Sysinternals tool Process Monitor instead, which basically is a beefed up Task Manager on steroids. Microsoft finally took some cues from that app and made the default Windows Task Manager smarter by adding some of the display features from Process Monitor. No longer do you need to guess what EXE programs are actually running since Task Manager now will show that information. Also, Task Manager incorporates several Administrative Tools into the app such as the Services tab (services.msc), Startup tab (from MSConfig tool), and a tab that shows App History. The new Task Manager is not designed to be a replacement for Process Monitor, but the new Task Manager is finally shaping up to be a useful tool. Why Microsoft never caught on to this in the past I will never know.\\n\\nWindows Media Center: \\nWMC in the Windows 8 Consumer Preview is exactly the same as the version in Windows 7\\\\. I never really used WMC so I don't have any major complaints or praises about it. But When I did launch it, it surprised me to find that when I chose the Express setup it didn't take several minutes for the scan to finish, it just went straight to the app. So I guess that was a pleasant surprise...0\\n\\nIssues that I have Experienced: \\nYes, I have had several issues over the past week with Windows 8 but to be honest, I think that these issues are to be expected since this is unfinished and unsupported software. The first issue I had was a blue screen of death and was one of the common \\\"nonfault page\\\" BSOD errors. This happened when I had at least 5 different applications open from the desktop and 3 different Metro apps running all at the same time. When I attempted to open a 4th Metro app the BSOD displayed and Windows automatically restarted after a few seconds. However, I have not had a BSOD since and it appears this issue was a one off type of situation. \\nAnother issue I had was when I was when I was attempting to install Evernote. I downloaded the EXE from Evernote.com and double-clicked on the installer file but nothing happened. Then, when I attempted to launch Explorer, Windows locked up. I could still move the mouse and strangely I could still go back to Metro UI and I could still launch Task Manager. But when I went back to the desktop, the view was completely locked up. I had to log out then log back in to fix the problem. \\nMy final issue that I have experienced was with installing an app from the Windows Store. I started the download for the app, but the download suddenly stopped and went back to the Store app. This had happened to me on several different occassions. But as soon as I attempt to install the app again, everything works just fine.\\n\\nMy Final Thoughts on the Windows 8 Consumer Preview: \\nMy experience so far has been great. Yes, I have had a few issues but nothing like some of the really really bad problems I have experienced with Windows XP general use or Windows Vista betas. Even though the Windows 8 official release is still several months away, it is clear that Microsoft is on the right track to fixing any remaining issues and finalizing the user interface with the desktop and Metro UI. Personally, I don't mind using the Windows 8 Consumer Preview as my primary OS at work and at home. I am already starting to prefer using Windows 8 over Windows 7 even with the new Metro UI. It is simply easy for me to work with the new interface and the fact that Microsoft is forcing me to be a \\\"keyboard junkie\\\" by learning shortcuts and learning how to work around the operating system interfaces makes me like the OS even more. Even at this time, I do prefer using Metro as the Start Menu. While I think Windows 8 still does need some more tweaking here and there, given more development time I'm sure it will be a fantastic product.\\n\\nWill Windows 8 be worth the upgrade when it is released? .... Ask me again when it is closer to the official release date...\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The Windows 8 Consumer Preview (a.k.a. the Windows 8 Public Beta #1) was released on February 29, 2012. Since I am the type of guy that likes to be on the 'up-and-up' with technology I decided to take the plunge and use Windows 8 exclusively at work and at home and see how things stack up. Like many of my other I.T. peers, I had a fantastic experience with the Windows 7 Public Beta a few years back so it is because of that experience on why I have decided to use Windows 8 ahead of it's official release. But of course, another motive to me using Windows 8 is to see if it really is what it is cracked up to be and maybe, just maybe, I would be the local expert at my place of work when Windows 8 is officially released. I did use the Windows 8 Developer Preview and, to be honest, I didn't see much reason for a business or consumer to actually upgrade to the new OS. But, I had already read several first impressions about the Consumer Preview and it looks like Microsoft is headed in the right direction. Will Windows 8 still do what I need it to do at my business? Does the new Metro UI interfere with the way that I use Windows on my desktop? And of course, will Windows 8 be worth the upgrade? Lets dive in an take a look...</p>\n<p>Installation and Upgrade:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.joedissmeyer.com\"><img src=\"http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/windows-8-metro-apps1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>The Clean Install on the Laptop:<br>\nThe clean install acts and performs just like a clean install when booting from a USB drive or DVD of Windows Vista or Windows 7. However, installation was surprisingly faster. Normally, it can take up to an hour for me to perform a clean install of Windows Vista until it boots to the &quot;out-of-box-experience&quot; (OOBE) first time boot screen. In Windows 7, it takes about 20 to 30 minutes for the computer to boot to the OOBE. But with Windows 8, I was at OOBE and up and running after only 14 minutes from start to finish.</p>\n<p>The Upgrade Install on my Desktop:<br>\nAfter booting up in the burned DVD of Windows 8 and running setup.exe, I was first prompted to reboot my PC to continue probably because I didn't reboot after installing some Windows Updates. After I rebooted and logged back in to the desktop, I had to manually kick off setup.exe again. I only had to answer 3 questions and the Windows 8 installer handled everything else. To my surprise, the upgrade was smooth and seamless. I have never, EVER, had a smooth and seamless upgrade from one operating system to another so I was baffled! The installation only took an hour and I didn't have to re-install ANY of my applications or restore ANY of my files from my backup external hard drive. This is definitely a big win for Microsoft in my opinion. Those that want to upgrade to Windows 8 from Windows Vista or Windows 7 will no longer have to worry about re-installing all of their apps and copying back their data from a backup drive to their computer after the upgrade completes. This is a very good thing for everyone.</p>\n<p>Device Drivers:<br>\nWindows 8 uses the exact same driver model as Windows Vista or Windows 7. As long as there is a driver available for your computer in Vista or Windows 7, you can install the hardware. Windows does a good enough job with finding and installing missing device drivers through Windows Update, but there is still some hardware that isn't detected during installation. An example of this scenario is with my Dell Latitude D630 that had the nVidia Quadro NVS discrete graphics. When I installed Windows 8 on the D630, the ONLY drivers missing were the nVidia graphics drivers. I had to download and install the Windows Vista driver pack from Dell's support site and viola, I had full graphics performance. All other hardware was detected and installed during Windows 8 Setup.<br>\nSomething else worth noting is that it no longer takes 5 to 30 seconds to install a driver for a mouse or keyboard in Windows 8. Windows 8 is now just as fast as Mac OS X Lion when plugging in a USB mouse - it only takes a second or two for the device to register and work as normal! I tried this out with several standard wired USB mice, as well as my Microsoft Explorer Touch Mouse that uses the Microsoft Bluetrack (not Bluetooth) micro USB dongle. As soon as I plugged in that micro USB dongle, the mouse was fully usable after a second.<br>\nBut back to video drivers, I did notice one thing with Windows 8 where even though I didn't have the graphics driver installed, I still had Windows Aero effects enabled. Apparently, Microsoft has decided to allow software acceleration for Aero if a video driver is missing. Video performance was very poor until I installed the nVidia driver (which is to be expected)...</p>\n<p>Performance:<br>\nAfter using Windows 8 for only a few minutes I immediately noticed drastic performance improvements. Basically, everything is <em><strong>faster</strong></em>. Now I don't mean that things seem fast just because a new OS is installed on the computer. I really do mean that things are faster, <em><strong>really fast</strong></em>. Loading desktop applications, transferring and copying files to\\from the hard drive, and playing games on Windows 8 is simply faster. I don't know if any of you downloaded and worked with the Windows 7 Public Betas a few years back, but I explicitly remember loading up Windows 7 Beta on a test PC and it was amazingly fast, much faster than even Windows 2000 on a decent, modern, computer. Even after Windows 7 was officially released, Windows 7 is was the speed champion as far as Windows OSes are concerned. But now it is my opinion that Windows 8 is faster than Windows 7. You can definitely tell that Microsoft is not playing around with Windows 8 and they are tweaking and fixing things, making the OS much faster than one would expect.</p>\n<p>Monitors - Dual Screens, Widescreen displays, and Standard displays:<br>\nI operate in a dual monitor environment on my work desktop. It is a Dell OptiPlex 780 with an ATI Radeon HD 4550 512mb dual head video card, 4GB of RAM, and a dual core Intel Core i5 processor. Both of my monitors are Dell 19 inch standard square monitors (not widescreen) with a maximum resolution of 1280x1024 per screen. The best feature regarding dual monitors is that Microsoft has finally spanned the toolbar across all monitor windows so I no longer have to install the Multimon 2.1 app on my deskop. Windows 8 also comes with a few very wide desktop backgrounds that span multiple monitors. My laptop has a 1440x900 widescreen display and I had the same experience.</p>\n<p>The New Start - Welcome to Metro UI:<br>\nStart is the first thing you see when you boot up the computer and log into it for the first time. Here is one very important concept that you need to understand with Windows 8 - Start is Metro UI. I will say that again - <em><strong><u>Start IS Metro UI</u></strong></em>. Chances are that in the future, we will probably all begin to start referring to &quot;Start&quot; as &quot;Metro&quot; and use the terms interchangeably. So, expect to hear someone say, &quot;Go back to Metro&quot; and at the same time they mean &quot;Go back to Start&quot;.

In Windows 7, it takes about 20 to 30 minutes for\nthe computer to boot to the OOBE. But with Windows 8, I was at OOBE and up and\nrunning after only 14 minutes from start to finish.\n\nThe Upgrade Install on my Desktop:\nAfter booting up in the burned DVD of Windows 8 and running setup.exe, I was\nfirst prompted to reboot my PC to continue probably because I didn't reboot\nafter installing some Windows Updates. After I rebooted and logged back in to\nthe desktop, I had to manually kick off setup.exe again. I only had to answer 3\nquestions and the Windows 8 installer handled everything else. To my surprise,\nthe upgrade was smooth and seamless. I have never, EVER, had a smooth and\nseamless upgrade from one operating system to another so I was baffled! The\ninstallation only took an hour and I didn't have to re-install ANY of my\napplications or restore ANY of my files from my backup external hard drive. This\nis definitely a big win for Microsoft in my opinion. Those that want to upgrade\nto Windows 8 from Windows Vista or Windows 7 will no longer have to worry about\nre-installing all of their apps and copying back their data from a backup drive\nto their computer after the upgrade completes. This is a very good thing for\neveryone.\n\nDevice Drivers:\nWindows 8 uses the exact same driver model as Windows Vista or Windows 7. As\nlong as there is a driver available for your computer in Vista or Windows 7, you\ncan install the hardware. Windows does a good enough job with finding and\ninstalling missing device drivers through Windows Update, but there is still\nsome hardware that isn't detected during installation. An example of this\nscenario is with my Dell Latitude D630 that had the nVidia Quadro NVS discrete\ngraphics. When I installed Windows 8 on the D630, the ONLY drivers missing were\nthe nVidia graphics drivers. I had to download and install the Windows Vista\ndriver pack from Dell's support site and viola, I had full graphics performance.\nAll other hardware was detected and installed during Windows 8 Setup.\nSomething else worth noting is that it no longer takes 5 to 30 seconds to\ninstall a driver for a mouse or keyboard in Windows 8. Windows 8 is now just as\nfast as Mac OS X Lion when plugging in a USB mouse - it only takes a second or\ntwo for the device to register and work as normal! I tried this out with several\nstandard wired USB mice, as well as my Microsoft Explorer Touch Mouse that uses\nthe Microsoft Bluetrack (not Bluetooth) micro USB dongle. As soon as I plugged\nin that micro USB dongle, the mouse was fully usable after a second.\nBut back to video drivers, I did notice one thing with Windows 8 where even\nthough I didn't have the graphics driver installed, I still had Windows Aero\neffects enabled. Apparently, Microsoft has decided to allow software\nacceleration for Aero if a video driver is missing. Video performance was very\npoor until I installed the nVidia driver (which is to be expected)...\n\nPerformance:\nAfter using Windows 8 for only a few minutes I immediately noticed drastic\nperformance improvements. Basically, everything is faster. Now I don't mean that\nthings seem fast just because a new OS is installed on the computer. I really do\nmean that things are faster, really fast. Loading desktop applications,\ntransferring and copying files to\\from the hard drive, and playing games on\nWindows 8 is simply faster. I don't know if any of you downloaded and worked\nwith the Windows 7 Public Betas a few years back, but I explicitly remember\nloading up Windows 7 Beta on a test PC and it was amazingly fast, much faster\nthan even Windows 2000 on a decent, modern, computer. Even after Windows 7 was\nofficially released, Windows 7 is was the speed champion as far as Windows OSes\nare concerned. But now it is my opinion that Windows 8 is faster than Windows 7.\nYou can definitely tell that Microsoft is not playing around with Windows 8 and\nthey are tweaking and fixing things, making the OS much faster than one would\nexpect.\n\nMonitors - Dual Screens, Widescreen displays, and Standard displays:\nI operate in a dual monitor environment on my work desktop. It is a Dell\nOptiPlex 780 with an ATI Radeon HD 4550 512mb dual head video card, 4GB of RAM,\nand a dual core Intel Core i5 processor. Both of my monitors are Dell 19 inch\nstandard square monitors (not widescreen) with a maximum resolution of 1280x1024\nper screen. The best feature regarding dual monitors is that Microsoft has\nfinally spanned the toolbar across all monitor windows so I no longer have to\ninstall the Multimon 2.1 app on my deskop. Windows 8 also comes with a few very\nwide desktop backgrounds that span multiple monitors. My laptop has a 1440x900\nwidescreen display and I had the same experience.\n\nThe New Start - Welcome to Metro UI:\nStart is the first thing you see when you boot up the computer and log into it\nfor the first time. Here is one very important concept that you need to\nunderstand with Windows 8 - Start is Metro UI. I will say that again - Start IS\nMetro UI. Chances are that in the future, we will probably all begin to start\nreferring to \"Start\" as \"Metro\" and use the terms interchangeably. So, expect to\nhear someone say, \"Go back to Metro\" and at the same time they mean \"Go back to\nStart\". The sooner you understand this concept the sooner you will find yourself\nimmersed in the new design of Windows 8. I am willing to bet that the more you\nuse Metro in Windows 8, you will find that the Metro design simply makes sense\nand I know that you will find that it is easier to use than the old Start Menus\nof previous versions of Windows. In my opinion, this is one more big win for\nMicrosoft because every new user to Windows OS has to learn the old Start Menu\nconcepts and it is not an easy thing to learn right off the bat. If you are\nusing a tablet or touchscreen, you will be using Metro quite often. If you are\nusing a laptop or desktop PC, you probably won't be using Start\\Metro as often\nas you think. It may seem intimidating at first, but if you are like me you will\nfind that the new Start is very easy to understand and work with. So lets get\nstarted....\nAll operating system software from Microsoft and Apple is trending to make all\napplications, features, accessories, or any other type of launchable application\nappear as a modular \"app\" accessible from an app icon on your home view. This is\nmuch like an app on your iPhone or Android device. The Windows Desktop is no\nexception to this rule. So in Windows 8, when you want to go back to the desktop\nview, simply click on the Desktop \"app\" tile from Start.\nIf you haven't noticed, there is no more \"Start Menu\" available from the desktop\nin Windows 8. There is no more Start Button on the task bar and there is no All\nPrograms list. Instead, you must become accustomed to using the new Metro\ninterface and the new \"Start\" is a part of that interface. Believe it or not,\nworking with the new Start is much easier and much faster compared to the\ntraditional Start Menu from the Windows OSes of old. To be honest, the new Start\njust makes sense. To get to Start, just move the mouse cursor to the very top or\nbottom left of the computer screen. A small thumbnail will appear. Click on it\nto go back to Start. Of course, you could also just hit the Windows key on your\nkeyboard.\nSearch is a BIG part of how to work with Start. If there is an application you\nwant to run, just start typing while Start is displayed on screen. If there is\nan email that you want to read, or need to find some type of information in a\ndocument, just start typing what you are looking for while Start is onscreen.\nOnce you try this just ONCE, you will be hooked. You just cannot screw this up.\nIt's foolproof! Also notice that as you install applications, new app tiles\nappear in Start just like an application icon or folder would appear in All\nPrograms in the Start Menu in Windows 7 or Windows XP. One would think that the\nnew Start doesn't work well in the business world but I beg the differ. The old\nstart menu in itself has been a problem ever since Windows NT and Windows 95.\nThe old Start Menu is buggy and never worked perfectly, even in Windows 7. This\nnew start in Metro UI is definitely a breath of fresh air and frankly, it just\nmakes sense.\n\nThe Desktop:\nYou will immediately notice that the desktop view looks almost identical to the\nWindows 7 desktop except that there is no more Start button (Start Orb) or Start\nMenu. In fact, EXPLORER.EXE is still the main part of the Windows Desktop\nexperience and EXPLORER.EXE does run as soon as you start up the computer. If\nyou are like me and don't have a tablet PC or touchscreen laptop, you will be\nworking in desktop view most of the time that you use Windows 8. So for those\nthat gripe about the new Start in Windows 8, I say \"Who cares!\". What I have\ndone is pin my most commonly used applications to the taskbar in the Desktop\nView. Doing this allows me to stay in Desktop view 95% of the time that I use my\nWindows 8 computers. Any apps that I need to quickly use, I perform the\nWindows+R keyboard shortcut to open the Run box and execute a command, or\nquickly hit the Windows key on the keyboard, type the app or feature name, then\nhit enter to launch that computer.\n\nHotspots:\nHotspots are the key to multitasking with Metro UI in Windows 8. Hotspots are\nthe very top or bottom left corners of the display window. The bottom left gets\nyou into Start, the top left is your app switcher much like hitting Alt+Tab on\nthe keyboard however Alt-Tab only works on the desktop and the hotspot only\nworks with Metro UI. If you have several Metro UI apps launched, such as the\nWindows Desktop and Remote Desktop, simply move the mouse cursor to the top left\nof the screen and wait a second for the first app thumbnail to display. Hover\nthe cursor over the app for a moment, and a left sidebar will appear onscreen\ndisplaying all of the open Metro apps, including Start at the bottom. So now you\nknow that you work with hotspots in Windows 8 when in either Desktop or Metro UI\nview and to get back to Start you work with hotspots. Move the mouse cursor to\nthe very bottom left of the display and you will see a thumbnail of Start. Click\non that thumbnail to return to Start. It's that simple.\n\nCharms:\nCharms is something new in Windows 8 and are quick shortcuts to common tasks\nwhile inside of an app. It operates like hotspots, but instead of the left side\nof the screen Charms are on the right side. Charms are designed to mostly be\nused while inside of a Metro App, but can be used from the desktop view. They\nprovide high level OS operations like go back to start, search, manage devices,\nor configure settings. I rarely use Charms in the Desktop view. But again,\nCharms are not really designed for desktop view anyways. Charms are designed to\nbe used from Metro apps. I like that Microsoft moved Charms to the right of the\nprimary monitor screen where the Show Desktop button in Windows 7 used to be. I\nnever used the Show Desktop feature anyways and the Charm display is now out of\nmy way. The only unfortunate thing in the new design is that the only way to\nShut Down or Restart Windows 8 is from the Settings Charm. But, this is just\nanother thing to get used to in Windows 8.\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts:\nSince I work in IT, I am used to opening the Run box and launching the command\nline from the Start Menu in Windows 7. Since the Start Menu is now gone for\ngood, I am being forced to learning the Windows shortcuts to launch the run box\ninstead of clicking Start > Run. Of course, I could just open Start and type\n\"cmd\" to search, then launch the command line app. But hitting Windows+R on the\nkeyboard is much, much, faster. Frankly, I am glad that Microsoft is forcing IT\nProfessionals actually  learn how to become a keyboard junkie :)\n\nRemote Desktop:\nRDC is a common application used to remotely connect to a server or desktop\ncomputer. Microsoft has provided a Metro app in Start called \"Remote Desktop\".\nThis is the same app as the classic RDC client but it runs in full screen mode.\nUnfortunately, I have had issues with the RDC Metro App crashing, or not\nallowing me to exit from a current RDC connection even after I have logged out.\nBut one good thing about the Remote Desktop Metro App is that it has built-in\n'tabs'. The tabs allows you to be able to have multiple RDC connections open at\nonce, then switch between them on demand within the app. Luckily, Microsoft has\nnot taken out MSTSC.EXE from Windows 8. Naturally, I still prefer launching\nMSTSC.EXE from Run or the Command Line and if I need tabbed views, I still\nprefer Terminals.\n\nWindows Explorer:\nThe Ribbon being built into Windows Explorer is definitely a breath of fresh\nair. No longer do I have to deal with trying to find the correct context menu\noptions when I right-click on a file to perform some specific file maintenance\ntasks. Also, the ISO mounting ability is a nice addition. But Explorer is where\nMicrosoft finally went back to fix some issues. For example, have you ever\nnoticed how long it takes to copy and paste a file from one location to another\nin Windows Vista? The file would finish copying but Explorer would take a few\nextra seconds to finish the job and close the progress bar pop-up. This issue\nhappens in Windows 7 too, but performance is a bit better than in Vista. Well,\nwith Windows 8 Microsoft finally 'fixed' the problem and it no longer takes\nextra time to finish the file maintenance task.\n\nTask Manager:\nThe old task manager from Windows 7 and before is just plain terrible. I have\nbeen using the Sysinternals tool Process Monitor instead, which basically is a\nbeefed up Task Manager on steroids. Microsoft finally took some cues from that\napp and made the default Windows Task Manager smarter by adding some of the\ndisplay features from Process Monitor. No longer do you need to guess what EXE\nprograms are actually running since Task Manager now will show that information.\nAlso, Task Manager incorporates several Administrative Tools into the app such\nas the Services tab (services.msc), Startup tab (from MSConfig tool), and a tab\nthat shows App History. The new Task Manager is not designed to be a replacement\nfor Process Monitor, but the new Task Manager is finally shaping up to be a\nuseful tool. Why Microsoft never caught on to this in the past I will never\nknow.\n\nWindows Media Center:\nWMC in the Windows 8 Consumer Preview is exactly the same as the version in\nWindows 7. I never really used WMC so I don't have any major complaints or\npraises about it. But When I did launch it, it surprised me to find that when I\nchose the Express setup it didn't take several minutes for the scan to finish,\nit just went straight to the app. So I guess that was a pleasant surprise...0\n\nIssues that I have Experienced:\nYes, I have had several issues over the past week with Windows 8 but to be\nhonest, I think that these issues are to be expected since this is unfinished\nand unsupported software. The first issue I had was a blue screen of death and\nwas one of the common \"nonfault page\" BSOD errors. This happened when I had at\nleast 5 different applications open from the desktop and 3 different Metro apps\nrunning all at the same time. When I attempted to open a 4th Metro app the BSOD\ndisplayed and Windows automatically restarted after a few seconds. However, I\nhave not had a BSOD since and it appears this issue was a one off type of\nsituation.\nAnother issue I had was when I was when I was attempting to install Evernote. I\ndownloaded the EXE from Evernote.com and double-clicked on the installer file\nbut nothing happened. Then, when I attempted to launch Explorer, Windows locked\nup. I could still move the mouse and strangely I could still go back to Metro UI\nand I could still launch Task Manager. But when I went back to the desktop, the\nview was completely locked up. I had to log out then log back in to fix the\nproblem.\nMy final issue that I have experienced was with installing an app from the\nWindows Store. I started the download for the app, but the download suddenly\nstopped and went back to the Store app. This had happened to me on several\ndifferent occassions. But as soon as I attempt to install the app again,\neverything works just fine.\n\nMy Final Thoughts on the Windows 8 Consumer Preview:\nMy experience so far has been great. Yes, I have had a few issues but nothing\nlike some of the really really bad problems I have experienced with Windows XP\ngeneral use or Windows Vista betas. Even though the Windows 8 official release\nis still several months away, it is clear that Microsoft is on the right track\nto fixing any remaining issues and finalizing the user interface with the\ndesktop and Metro UI. Personally, I don't mind using the Windows 8 Consumer\nPreview as my primary OS at work and at home. I am already starting to prefer\nusing Windows 8 over Windows 7 even with the new Metro UI. It is simply easy for\nme to work with the new interface and the fact that Microsoft is forcing me to\nbe a \"keyboard junkie\" by learning shortcuts and learning how to work around the\noperating system interfaces makes me like the OS even more. Even at this time, I\ndo prefer using Metro as the Start Menu. While I think Windows 8 still does need\nsome more tweaking here and there, given more development time I'm sure it will\nbe a fantastic product.\n\nWill Windows 8 be worth the upgrade when it is released? .... Ask me again when\nit is closer to the official release date...","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2012-03-12T22:00:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2012-03-12T22:00:05.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2012-03-12T22:00:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc7c2","uuid":"16ef184e-4dad-47c1-aac7-38d6fc6cf397","title":"The Windows 8 Family of Software: Betas and Consumer Previews","slug":"the_windows_8_family_of_software_betas_and_consumer_previews","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"We all know that the Windows 8 Consumer Preview was released on Feb. 29th 2012\\\\.

The errors that appeared in the final\nsummary were in the following order:\n\nThe network path was not found\nThe network path was not found\nThe network path was not found\n_ERROR – Unable to map a network drive to \\server\\mdt$_\nApplication 1 returned an unexpected return code: 1\nApplication 2 returned an unexpected return code: 1\nApplication 3 returned an unexpected return code: 2\nApplication 4 returned an unexpected return code: 1\n(A screenshot of what I was seeing is displayed below) \n[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XJBUrvcgXIY/TzAUim_m23I/AAAAAAAAAx4/sRwA67-xpkw/s1600/2012-02-06+08h13_23.png]\n\nWhat made this error even stranger was that only the first few applications\nskipped installation due to MDT not able to map a network drive to my MDT share,\nbut the rest of them did install fine. When the final summary screen displayed,\nI opened My Computer and there was a mapped network drive to my deployment\nshare! Strange indeed…\n\nEvaluation of the BDD.LOG file confirms that MDT was unable to map a drive but\nafter a few attempts it eventually mapped the drive and continued the\napplication installation process. It was clear that the issue had to do with\naccess to the network share.\n\nI went back and looked at bootstrap.ini and customsettings.ini. When I really\nlooked at the settings in bootstrap.ini is when the cause of the problem became\nclear to me. The “DeployRoot” variable was set to \\server\\share$, it needed to\nbe \\server\\share$. The difference is subtle, but it makes a big difference.\nSimply removing the backslash from the end of the line and rebuilding the boot\nimage resolved the issue.\n\nHere is what my bootstrap.ini looked like when the issue was occurring:\n\n[Settings]\nPriority=Default\n**\n[Default]**\nDeployRoot=\\server.domain.com\\mdt$\\      <-- With backslash\n\nHere is what it looks like now:\n\n[Settings]\nPriority=Default\n**\n[Default]**\nDeployRoot=\\server.domain.com\\mdt$       <-- Without the backslash\n\nAgain, the difference may be hard to see the first time but just remove the\nbackslash from the end of the DeployRoot variable.

This is how a DNS server knows where to tell your computer to send\nit’s communications to. Each entry in the database is called a record and\nchanges to DNS records occur millions of times per minute. DNS servers hosted by\nproviders such as GoDaddy, ENOM, NetFirms, etc. are considered “top level” and\nthe DNS record information is first replicated amongst each other, then\neventually get replicated to other DNS servers on demand. Every ISP has their\nown hosted DNS server and the problem with an ISP DNS is that it is sometimes\noutdated and unreliable; such was the case with this customer...\n\nWhy does changing the DNS settings on the customer’s network fix this problem?\nDNS databases can become corrupt on the router, or DNS is corrupt on the ISP’s\nside, or a DNS server has not retrieved new or updated information from other\nworldwide DNS servers, or any other type of DNS networking factor. Forcing a\ncomputer or router to communicate with a specific DNS server that has current\nand reliable DNS information is a way to permanently fix a DNS problem.\n\nHow can you change DNS settings on your own? First, you need to decide what DNS\nserver you want to define in the DNS settings on your router or your computer.\nTwo very popular DNS services (which are free) are or OpenDNS.org\n[http://www.opendns.com/]\n\nWith this customer, I decided to go with Google’s Public DNS because I have had\ngood experience with it in the past. Sure enough, it works just fine and helped\nme get the customer back up and running. A nice side effect of changing to\nGoogle Public DNS is that the internet performance on the customer’s computer\n(going from website to website) increased dramatically .\n\nNow, if you are not having issues with your current ISP and are able to surf the\ninternet without any issues, I DO NOT recommend changing your DNS settings\nbecause “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!” Otherwise if you know what you are\ndoing, feel free to update your DNS settings. I hope you have learned something\ninteresting in this post! As always, feel free to leave a comment below.

Are you with me so far? Excellent. It is time to address some additional questions…\\n\\nThe next thing to think about is: will the organization delete your email account when you are no longer a part of the organization? This all depends on the organization’s policies but in most cases the answer is <font color=\\\"#00ff00\\\">yes</font>. In any case where you leave an organization you must count on your e-mail accounts assigned to you including _all data that resides inside that account_ can/will be deleted – permanently. Here are some examples of cases where one of the e-mail accounts that has been assigned to you _could_ be deleted:\\n\\n* <font color=\\\"#00ff00\\\">Work or Business:</font> If you leave a company willingly, or are let go from that company, count on that e-mail address and all of the data inside of it permanently deleted or archived. If you need to recover data from that e-mail account, keep in mind that since the e-mail account didn’t truly belong to you in the first place there is no obligation from that company to help you recover data from it. Plus, there is a certain e-mail etiquette with business e-mail accounts – You are expected to conduct business with an email account given to you by a business. It is not for personal use so don’t use it like it is your own personal e-mail account! (Shopping and Coupon ad emails are a big no-no.)\\n* <font color=\\\"#00ff00\\\">Internet Service Provider:</font> Many internet service providers (ISP) will grant you an email address, such as Comcast, AT&T, or Verizon. But when you shut off your internet service and stop paying them, the email addresses assigned to you are permanently deleted. And when an ISP deletes an email account, there is no such things as ‘data recovery’…\\n* <font color=\\\"#00ff00\\\">School or College:</font> Unless there is a clause in the enrollment agreement somewhere that says your student email address will remain in existence for an eternity, count on your e-mail account being deleted after a certain period of time when you graduate or stop taking classes.\\n* <font color=\\\"#00ff00\\\">Organizations:</font> Do not count on your email account remaining intact after you are no longer affiliated with an organization such as a non-profit. Remember the e-mail etiquette with organizations as well.\\n\\nWith all of this said, do you have a backup plan in case an assigned e-mail account is no longer available? Better yet, do you have a personal e-mail address set up? I highly recommend that you set up a personal e-mail account from Google (Gmail), Microsoft (Windows Live Mail / Hotmail), Yahoo (Yahoo! Mail), or any of the other free e-mail account providers and use it _outside_ of an organization. The free e-mail providers really do provide a great service and most have other services tied-in with their free e-mail such as online file storage or social applications.\\n\\nSo I hope that I have helped you come back to reality regarding assigned e-mail accounts.

The essence of\nwhat I am actually trying to ask here is: Does the email account or email\naddress that was given to you at school, work, or in an organization actually\nbelong  to you? I am fairly certain that if I had a room full of people and I\nasked this question, 99% of the people have probably never thought about that\nquestion, let alone ever think about someone ever asking them this question \n[http://mail.google.com]\n\nThe Question: Does the e-mail address that you use at work or school actually\nbelong to you?\nThe Answer: Absolutely not.\n\nAn e-mail account assigned to you by an organization does not  belong to you and\nyou are most certainly not  entitled to having one_._ It, and almost  all of the\ndata inside of that account, belongs to the organization. Are you with me so\nfar? Excellent. It is time to address some additional questions…\n\nThe next thing to think about is: will the organization delete your email\naccount when you are no longer a part of the organization? This all depends on\nthe organization’s policies but in most cases the answer is yes. In any case\nwhere you leave an organization you must count on your e-mail accounts assigned\nto you including all data that resides inside that account  can/will be deleted\n– permanently. Here are some examples of cases where one of the e-mail accounts\nthat has been assigned to you could  be deleted:\n\n * Work or Business:  If you leave a company willingly, or are let go from that\n   company, count on that e-mail address and all of the data inside of it\n   permanently deleted or archived. If you need to recover data from that e-mail\n   account, keep in mind that since the e-mail account didn’t truly belong to\n   you in the first place there is no obligation from that company to help you\n   recover data from it. Plus, there is a certain e-mail etiquette with business\n   e-mail accounts – You are expected to conduct business with an email account\n   given to you by a business. It is not for personal use so don’t use it like\n   it is your own personal e-mail account! (Shopping and Coupon ad emails are a\n   big no-no.)\n * Internet Service Provider:  Many internet service providers (ISP) will grant\n   you an email address, such as Comcast, AT&T, or Verizon. But when you shut\n   off your internet service and stop paying them, the email addresses assigned\n   to you are permanently deleted. And when an ISP deletes an email account,\n   there is no such things as ‘data recovery’…\n * School or College:  Unless there is a clause in the enrollment agreement\n   somewhere that says your student email address will remain in existence for\n   an eternity, count on your e-mail account being deleted after a certain\n   period of time when you graduate or stop taking classes.\n * Organizations:  Do not count on your email account remaining intact after you\n   are no longer affiliated with an organization such as a non-profit. Remember\n   the e-mail etiquette with organizations as well.\n\nWith all of this said, do you have a backup plan in case an assigned e-mail\naccount is no longer available? Better yet, do you have a personal e-mail\naddress set up? I highly recommend that you set up a personal e-mail account\nfrom Google (Gmail), Microsoft (Windows Live Mail / Hotmail), Yahoo (Yahoo!\nMail), or any of the other free e-mail account providers and use it outside  of\nan organization. The free e-mail providers really do provide a great service and\nmost have other services tied-in with their free e-mail such as online file\nstorage or social applications.\n\nSo I hope that I have helped you come back to reality regarding assigned e-mail\naccounts. You never know when this information becomes handy. Let a friend know\nthis information too.

It went a little something like this, “So this computer is five years old and it is running really slow. Any way you can make this computer run a bit faster? We don’t have any money in the budget to purchase a new computer…”. Yes, I did help the person out by performing a few steps to give the computer some ‘new life’ which I will talk about further down in this post. Not a week goes by where I don’t see or hear some type of TV commercial or online marketing ad, or magazine article with the heading “Speed up your computer!” or “How to get your computer running like it is brand new”. Everyone has their own ideas of how to get a computer running like it is brand new. In the end, they always suggest to buy or run some maintenance software which more often than not, does NOT help with improving the performance of the computer. Sometimes they recommend to buy hardware upgrades. But what actually works? How can you actually improve the performance of your computer without spending any money or installing additional software? Lets take a look at some of the things you can do that actually helps to speed up your computer again, shall we? \\n\\nThere is one thing the I need to address first. _Yes_, there is one (and I repeat, _only one_) thing that I recommend you spend money on to help increase performance in your computer, and that is to upgrade the memory in your computer\\\\laptop. \\n\\nAdding more RAM installed in your computer actually does increase performance in your computer. But is it worth the cost? It depends. If your computer is more than 5 years old I do not recommend that you purchase anything for it. You really should start looking for a new computer. The computer should support DDR2-type or DDR3-type memory. Anything older than that becomes too expensive to upgrade. Last, your computer should have at least 2GB installed. Unless you are doing some serious video editing or gaming, there is no real need of having more than 2GB of memory. Don’t spend the cash if you don’t need to. \\n\\n***I do not ever, EVER, recommend anyone to purchase software that claims to help speed up your computer (*cough* Norton Tools *cough*!) and I never, EVER, recommend that anyone go to a website that claims to speed up your computer because they are both a rip off (I am talking about you, …). \\nLets move on to talking about the stuff you can do to speed up your computer for free… \\n\\n**Number #1: Run the Disk Defragmenter at least once per month.** \\nThis single step takes care of a great deal of performance issues in almost every computer. To run Disk Defragmenter, click Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Disk Defragmenter. Let it run during a lunch break or overnight at least once per month. Also, make sure to run Disk Defragmenter AFTER you make any changes to the computer such as install a new program or delete a bunch of stuff. \\n\\n**Number #2: Set the Virtual Memory cache to “System Managed”.** \\nThis is something that is still a problem in Windows XP. Windows really _does_ know how to handle memory. But when a specific limit is placed on how Windows is allowed to manage the virtual memory, you can start seeing errors like “Not enough memory” or “Virtual Memory is too low”. By default, Windows XP and Windows 2000 sets the virtual memory limit to 1.5 times the amount of RAM installed in the computer (including virtual machines installations of Windows XP!), but Windows 7 automatically has virtual memory set to system managed. The process for making this change is the same in Windows 7 and Windows XP. To change this setting: \\n\\n* Click Start. Right click on “My Computer”, choose Properties.\\n* Click on the Advanced tab.\\n* Under Performance, click the “Settings” button.\\n* Click on the Advanced tab.\\n* Under Virtual Memory, click “Change” button.\\n* Make sure the C: volume is highlighted. Click “System Managed Size” bullet option, then click the “Set” button.\\n* Click OK. A warning appears onscreen to let you know to reboot the computer.\\n* Click OK to close the Performance Options window, then click OK to close the Computer Properties window. Reboot the computer when prompted.\\n\\n**Number #3: Clear out all of the junk data in %TEMP%.** \\nWhat is %TEMP%? This is the temporary files folder that Windows ‘dumps’ temp data into. FYI about Windows – Windows never cleans up the TEMP folder on its own. Over the years, it is possible to use up a lot of disk space with just temporary file data. It is a good idea to clean out this folder from time to time as some common programs rely on this folder to work. Also, old data can be too old or become corrupt and make a program run slower. To clean out the %TEMP% folder in all versions of Windows: \\n\\n* Click Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Command Prompt\\n* Type “%TEMP%” without quotes, hit enter.\\n* Windows Explorer will open in a new window displaying the temporary files folder. Delete all of the files you can in this folder, then empty the Recycle Bin. **Some files are locked. Don’t worry if you cannot delete all of the files.\\n\\n**Number #4: Remove programs from the computer that you do not use.** \\nGet rid of the software that you don’t use any more. This will help to clean up disk space, and may also remove some services from starting up when you boot the computer (there by increasing computer performance). If you bought a different printer, make sure that old printer software is removed. For example, you used to own an HP printer. Last year, you threw out that HP printer and bought a Lexmark printer but the HP printer software is still installed. Remove the HP software. The correct way of removing software from your computer is through the Control Panel. \\n\\n* In Windows XP, click Start > Control Panel. Change to “Classic View” in the left navigation bar and double-click on “Add\\\\Remove Programs”. Highlight a program from the list and choose “Change”, “Remove”, or “Uninstall” to go through the uninstall process for that particular program.\\n* In Windows 7, click Start > Control Panel. Under Programs, click on “Uninstall a program”. Highlight a program in the list and choose “Change”, “Remove”, or “Uninstall” to go through the uninstall process for that particular program.\\n\\n**Number #5: Remove all browser toolbars from the computer.** \\nThis includes the Bing Bar, Google Toolbar, Yahoo! Toolbar, etc. Toolbars make your web browser slower, which unfortunately is by design. Get rid of them to reclaim your browser speed! To remove a toolbar app, follow the same steps to remove an application in step #4. \\nNumber #6: Delete all cached data stored in your web browser. \\nAll web browsers save a copy of all website data in a folder on your computer as you visit a site. Browsers do this to attempt to speed up the browsing experience by not having to re-download the same data all the time. There is usually a limit set for how much data it will actually store on your computer, but most browsers do a terrible job of cleaning up the old data. Every once in a while, you should clear out the browser cache data on the computer. Doing this will make your web browsing experience faster. Deleting the cache data may also help resolve any issues you could be having, or have had at one point in time, with a particular web site (such as errors or other problems). To do this in your web browser, click on an appropriate link below: \\n\\n* [Internet Explorer](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260897)\\n* [Mozilla Firefox](http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/How%20to%20clear%20the%20cache)\\n* [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95582)\\n\\n**Number #6: Remove entries from the Startup tab in the MSCONFIG tool.** \\nMSCONFIG is the System Configuration tool. You can disable services and other advanced things. The Startup tab is the most interesting feature because it displays all programs that run when you boot up the machine. You should remove any program from the list that you don’t use or don’t recognize as this will help to boot the machine faster, and not have a bunch of unknown programs run all the time. **WARNING: If you don’t know what the program name is, do a Google search first BEFORE removing the entry from the Startup tab.** To open the MSCONFIG tool: \\n\\n* Click Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Command Prompt.\\n* Type “c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\msconfig.exe” without quotes and hit enter.\\n* The System Configuration tool will appear onscreen. Click on the Startup tab and start looking at the program list.\\n\\n**Number #7: Make sure your antivirus software is set to run virus scans overnight, and actually let the scans run at that time!** \\nGo back and read one of my previous posts for a reason on why you should do this. I can’t leave any instructions on how to do this because of how many different anti-virus apps are out there. You will have to find out how to do this by yourself. Sorry… \\n\\n**Number #8: Keep your Software Up-to-date!** \\nRun Windows Updates, Microsoft Updates, Adobe Flash Player updates, Adobe Player updates, etc. This should be a given. Always make sure that you are running your computer and programs will the latest security and software updates. This makes sure your computer is as secure as it can be. Security updates also fix bugs and flaws, such as those that cause memory leaks (which eat up memory in your computer and can cause it to crash). \\n\\nSo, that concludes this extremely long post on how to speed up your computer. This is a pretty comprehensive list of some steps you can take to make your computer faster, as well as more secure and updated. Do you have more tips on how to speed up your computer?

It went a little something like this, “So this computer is\nfive years old and it is running really slow. Any way you can make this computer\nrun a bit faster? We don’t have any money in the budget to purchase a new\ncomputer…”. Yes, I did help the person out by performing a few steps to give the\ncomputer some ‘new life’ which I will talk about further down in this post. Not\na week goes by where I don’t see or hear some type of TV commercial or online\nmarketing ad, or magazine article with the heading “Speed up your computer!” or\n“How to get your computer running like it is brand new”. Everyone has their own\nideas of how to get a computer running like it is brand new. In the end, they\nalways suggest to buy or run some maintenance software which more often than\nnot, does NOT help with improving the performance of the computer. Sometimes\nthey recommend to buy hardware upgrades. But what actually works? How can you\nactually improve the performance of your computer without spending any money or\ninstalling additional software? Lets take a look at some of the things you can\ndo that actually helps to speed up your computer again, shall we?\n\nThere is one thing the I need to address first. Yes, there is one (and I repeat,\n only one) thing that I recommend you spend money on to help increase\nperformance in your computer, and that is to upgrade the memory in your\ncomputer\\laptop.\n\nAdding more RAM installed in your computer actually does increase performance in\nyour computer. But is it worth the cost? It depends. If your computer is more\nthan 5 years old I do not recommend that you purchase anything for it. You\nreally should start looking for a new computer. The computer should support\nDDR2-type or DDR3-type memory. Anything older than that becomes too expensive to\nupgrade. Last, your computer should have at least 2GB installed. Unless you are\ndoing some serious video editing or gaming, there is no real need of having more\nthan 2GB of memory. Don’t spend the cash if you don’t need to.\n\n***I do not ever, EVER, recommend anyone to purchase software that claims to\nhelp speed up your computer (cough  Norton Tools cough!) and I never, EVER,\nrecommend that anyone go to a website that claims to speed up your computer\nbecause they are both a rip off (I am talking about you, …).\nLets move on to talking about the stuff you can do to speed up your computer for\nfree…\n\nNumber #1: Run the Disk Defragmenter at least once per month.\nThis single step takes care of a great deal of performance issues in almost\nevery computer. To run Disk Defragmenter, click Start > All Programs >\nAccessories > System Tools > Disk Defragmenter. Let it run during a lunch break\nor overnight at least once per month. Also, make sure to run Disk Defragmenter\nAFTER you make any changes to the computer such as install a new program or\ndelete a bunch of stuff.\n\nNumber #2: Set the Virtual Memory cache to “System Managed”.\nThis is something that is still a problem in Windows XP. Windows really does \nknow how to handle memory. But when a specific limit is placed on how Windows is\nallowed to manage the virtual memory, you can start seeing errors like “Not\nenough memory” or “Virtual Memory is too low”. By default, Windows XP and\nWindows 2000 sets the virtual memory limit to 1.5 times the amount of RAM\ninstalled in the computer (including virtual machines installations of Windows\nXP!), but Windows 7 automatically has virtual memory set to system managed. The\nprocess for making this change is the same in Windows 7 and Windows XP. To\nchange this setting:\n\n * Click Start. Right click on “My Computer”, choose Properties.\n * Click on the Advanced tab.\n * Under Performance, click the “Settings” button.\n * Click on the Advanced tab.\n * Under Virtual Memory, click “Change” button.\n * Make sure the C: volume is highlighted. Click “System Managed Size” bullet\n   option, then click the “Set” button.\n * Click OK. A warning appears onscreen to let you know to reboot the computer.\n * Click OK to close the Performance Options window, then click OK to close the\n   Computer Properties window. Reboot the computer when prompted.\n\nNumber #3: Clear out all of the junk data in %TEMP%.\nWhat is %TEMP%? This is the temporary files folder that Windows ‘dumps’ temp\ndata into. FYI about Windows – Windows never cleans up the TEMP folder on its\nown. Over the years, it is possible to use up a lot of disk space with just\ntemporary file data. It is a good idea to clean out this folder from time to\ntime as some common programs rely on this folder to work. Also, old data can be\ntoo old or become corrupt and make a program run slower. To clean out the %TEMP%\nfolder in all versions of Windows:\n\n * Click Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Command Prompt\n * Type “%TEMP%” without quotes, hit enter.\n * Windows Explorer will open in a new window displaying the temporary files\n   folder. Delete all of the files you can in this folder, then empty the\n   Recycle Bin. **Some files are locked. Don’t worry if you cannot delete all of\n   the files.\n\nNumber #4: Remove programs from the computer that you do not use.\nGet rid of the software that you don’t use any more. This will help to clean up\ndisk space, and may also remove some services from starting up when you boot the\ncomputer (there by increasing computer performance). If you bought a different\nprinter, make sure that old printer software is removed. For example, you used\nto own an HP printer. Last year, you threw out that HP printer and bought a\nLexmark printer but the HP printer software is still installed. Remove the HP\nsoftware. The correct way of removing software from your computer is through the\nControl Panel.\n\n * In Windows XP, click Start > Control Panel. Change to “Classic View” in the\n   left navigation bar and double-click on “Add\\Remove Programs”. Highlight a\n   program from the list and choose “Change”, “Remove”, or “Uninstall” to go\n   through the uninstall process for that particular program.\n * In Windows 7, click Start > Control Panel. Under Programs, click on\n   “Uninstall a program”. Highlight a program in the list and choose “Change”,\n   “Remove”, or “Uninstall” to go through the uninstall process for that\n   particular program.\n\nNumber #5: Remove all browser toolbars from the computer.\nThis includes the Bing Bar, Google Toolbar, Yahoo! Toolbar, etc. Toolbars make\nyour web browser slower, which unfortunately is by design. Get rid of them to\nreclaim your browser speed! To remove a toolbar app, follow the same steps to\nremove an application in step #4.\nNumber #6: Delete all cached data stored in your web browser.\nAll web browsers save a copy of all website data in a folder on your computer as\nyou visit a site. Browsers do this to attempt to speed up the browsing\nexperience by not having to re-download the same data all the time. There is\nusually a limit set for how much data it will actually store on your computer,\nbut most browsers do a terrible job of cleaning up the old data. Every once in a\nwhile, you should clear out the browser cache data on the computer. Doing this\nwill make your web browsing experience faster. Deleting the cache data may also\nhelp resolve any issues you could be having, or have had at one point in time,\nwith a particular web site (such as errors or other problems). To do this in\nyour web browser, click on an appropriate link below:\n\n * Internet Explorer [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260897]\n * Mozilla Firefox\n   [http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/How%20to%20clear%20the%20cache]\n * Google Chrome\n   [http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95582]\n\nNumber #6: Remove entries from the Startup tab in the MSCONFIG tool.\nMSCONFIG is the System Configuration tool. You can disable services and other\nadvanced things. The Startup tab is the most interesting feature because it\ndisplays all programs that run when you boot up the machine. You should remove\nany program from the list that you don’t use or don’t recognize as this will\nhelp to boot the machine faster, and not have a bunch of unknown programs run\nall the time. WARNING: If you don’t know what the program name is, do a Google\nsearch first BEFORE removing the entry from the Startup tab.  To open the\nMSCONFIG tool:\n\n * Click Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Command Prompt.\n * Type “c:\\windows\\system32\\msconfig.exe” without quotes and hit enter.\n * The System Configuration tool will appear onscreen. Click on the Startup tab\n   and start looking at the program list.\n\nNumber #7: Make sure your antivirus software is set to run virus scans\novernight, and actually let the scans run at that time!\nGo back and read one of my previous posts for a reason on why you should do\nthis. I can’t leave any instructions on how to do this because of how many\ndifferent anti-virus apps are out there. You will have to find out how to do\nthis by yourself. Sorry…\n\nNumber #8: Keep your Software Up-to-date!\nRun Windows Updates, Microsoft Updates, Adobe Flash Player updates, Adobe Player\nupdates, etc. This should be a given. Always make sure that you are running your\ncomputer and programs will the latest security and software updates. This makes\nsure your computer is as secure as it can be. Security updates also fix bugs and\nflaws, such as those that cause memory leaks (which eat up memory in your\ncomputer and can cause it to crash).\n\nSo, that concludes this extremely long post on how to speed up your computer.\nThis is a pretty comprehensive list of some steps you can take to make your\ncomputer faster, as well as more secure and updated.

Restart the Office activation service on the local machine:\n    Cscript “c:\\Program Files (x86)\\microsoft office\\office14\\OSPP.VBS”\n    /osppsvcrestart\n    \n    \n 3. Permit administrator-priviledged license operations including\n    internet\\telephone activation by standard users (I probably didn’t need to\n    do this, but I did it on my own computer anyways):\n    Cscript “c:\\Program Files (x86)\\microsoft office\\office14\\OSPP.VBS”\n    /puserops\n    \n    \n 4. Manually set the KMS Host to activate against:\n    Cscript “c:\\Program Files (x86)\\microsoft office\\office14\\OSPP.VBS”\n    /sethst:[FQDN OF KMS HOST]\n    Example: Cscript “c:\\Program Files (x86)\\microsoft office\\office14\\OSPP.VBS”\n    /sethst:server1.contoso.local  <— No spaces after the colon.\n    \n    \n 5. Force Office activation:\n    Cscript “c:\\Program Files (x86)\\microsoft office\\office14\\OSPP.VBS” /act\n    \n    \n\nThese commands can be entered into a batch file for easy fixin’.\n**To use these commands on a 32 bit machine, just remove the (X86) text from\neach line.\n\n * Joe","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2011-10-12T13:14:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2011-10-12T13:15:05.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2011-10-12T13:14:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc7d5","uuid":"2531228f-6e67-4a12-a58a-1c1cfdcf74a4","title":"Does your internet connection drop out from time to time?

This means no streaming music, no web browsing, and no internet access at all. Of course, once an ip address is assigned to the modem from my ISP, viola! Internet access is restored. This example is just in my own instance and others may not have these types of issues. But if you are a Comcast customer, their DHCP leases are even shorter (and even shorter still in heavily populated areas such as apartments or heavy urban areas like Downtown Seattle or Orlando). Why do ISPs have DHCP leases set for a very short period of time? Because there are no more IPv4 addresses left in the world and they are a very expensive commodity. At this time, because the world is still heavily reliant on IPv4 addressing, ISPs are forced to assign IPv4 addresses to both businesses and home customers.

Or that the one of our branch offices has intermittent network drop-outs during the day at random times (some of our branch offices have Comcast as their ISP provider), or that a customer loses internet connection at a specific time per day but then everything works fine after a few minutes. **There is a way to check a modem's DHCP lease time by logging directly into the modem and looking at the logs.... look for 'time to live' or 'lease time'...\\n\\nSo the final question would be, \\\"is there a way to make it so that there are no network drop-outs due to DHCP renewals?\\\" .... No. This is simply the way that TCP/IP networks are designed at this time. Unless ISPs decide to change their policies regarding their DHCP server settings, the answer will forever be NO. But like I said, IPv6 fixes this problem. With IPv6, there is an almost infinite number of IP addresses that can be assigned (in the trillions!) to thousands of devices and there may not be a need to use DHCP with IPv6 (no refreshing IP addresses, no needing to recycle IP addresses, and so on).

Many people, like me, who started out working in 1st level support usually stay in this role for a couple of years before moving into a higher level position. You tend to pick up a great deal of troubleshooting and networking knowledge while working on the help desk. I also have a great deal of respect for those who work in the help desk – it is not an easy job! But I must admit that sometimes, I get a little frustrated when one of the most common issues gets pushed up to the next level of support with absolutely zero troubleshooting done by the 1st level technician. Anyhoo, lets get started with the post… \\n\\nThere is an issue with Windows where network drives (which may also be called shared drives or network shared folders) assigned by Group Policy do not automatically map after a user logs into a computer that is joined to a domain. This issue occurs on all versions of Windows and it occurs at random. Why does this happen? Because Windows processes login settings regardless if Windows has initialized network connections or not.

Luckily, I had a spare 500GB drive that I could upgrade to.\nBut I did not want to re-install Windows, deal with calling Microsoft to\nre-activate Windows, and re-install all of my software. All that I needed to do\nwas move  the Windows install to the other hard drive. After a little bit of\ntime, I figured out how to do this and am very pleased with the results. If you\nwant to do this, here are some simple rules:\n\n*The drive that you want to move the Windows installation to needs to be EXACTLY\nthe same hard drive size as your current drive or larger. For example, if your\nWindows installation is on a 40GB hard drive then you need to have a 40GB hard\ndrive or larger available.\n\n*A full system image backup can be as large as the size of the hard drive that\nWindows is installed on so make sure you have an external hard drive that is\nlarge enough to handle the backup. Otherwise, make sure you have enough DVD-Rs\nto create a full system image spanned across a DVD set.\n\n*Keep in mind that you cannot ‘move’ your Windows 7 installation to a new\ncomputer. That requires Windows to be re-activated and possibly force you to buy\na new Windows 7 license. These procedures are only for moving your installation\nto a different or larger hard drive on the same  computer.\n\nSo, without further ado, here is the procedure for moving your Windows 7\ninstallation to a different hard drive on the same computer:\n\n1. Open the Control Panel > System and Security > Backup and Restore.\n2. On the left panel, choose “Create System Image”.\n3. Save Windows system image to an external hard drive.\n4. Burn a system restore disk when prompted.\n5. Turn off the computer. Remove the old hard drive, insert the new one.\n6. Boot the PC with the System Restore Disk.\n7. Restore the saved system image and boot into Windows.\n\nAt this point, Windows has been restored with all of your files and\napplications. If you moved to a different hard drive that was the same size as\nthe last one, then you are done. But if you migrated to a larger hard drive,\ncontinue with the steps below.\n\n8. Open the command line.\n9. Execute “bcdboot c:\\windows /s c:”.\n10. Open Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Computer Management.\n11. Click on Disk Management. Right click the c: partition and choose “Set as\nActive”. Click Yes at the warning prompt.\n12. Reboot the computer. Log back into Windows.\n13. Open Disk Management and delete the BDEdrive partition.\n14. Right-click the C: partition and choose “Extend Volume”.\n15. Choose your options on how to want to extend the volume. Usually, you simply\nwant to extend the volume to include all of the unallocated space. Finish the\nextension and verify the results.\n16. Done.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2011-01-17T04:07:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2011-08-29T14:16:28.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2011-01-17T04:07:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc7ef","uuid":"9610ae31-7954-46d2-ab5b-d93ecfe03280","title":"Install application based on OS version by using a Batch File","slug":"install_application_based_on_os_version_by_using_a_batch_file","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"One of the things that I need to do from time to time is install an application![](http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/harwen/pleasant/256/MS-DOS-Batch-File-icon.png) depending on the OS type and version.

The reason? Someone was able to gain access to at least one of\ntheir account by guessing the password or by workarounds (mainstream media likes\nto call this “hacking” an account). In most of the cases that I helped with,\nevery single one of the users’ passwords were exactly the same \n[http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wrT9VW078bU/TO81S1wPswI/AAAAAAAAAUM/_yKg4QJFcNs/s1600-h/image%5B2%5D.png]\n\n1. Strong Passwords\n\nStrong passwords are the bare minimum for most websites and most businesses. A\nbasic strong password is a minimum of 8 characters long and has at least 3 of\nthese 4 rules:\n\n * Capital Letter\n * Lowercase Letter\n * Number\n * Symbol (!,@,#,$,%,^,&,*,(,),_,+,?)\n\nSome examples of poor passwords are “computer” or “joseph”. But an acceptable\nstrong password may be ” or “m1cr*s0fT”. Now, I don’t suggest that you use any\nof these strong passwords that I have just typed but I hope you get the point \n“C@mputer01 [%E2%80%9CC@mputer01]\n\nhas a free Password Strength Utility online\n[https://www.microsoft.com/protect/fraud/passwords/checker.aspx?WT.mc_id=Site_Link]\n\n2. Do not have any personal information or confidential information in your\npassword\n\nEven though your password is personal only to you, do not include ANY personal\nor confidential information anywhere in your password or any variant of personal\ninformation in your password –> and I do mean ANY VARIANT.  If your address is\n“123 Password Lane”, do NOT include “123”, “pass”, “word”, “lane” or “ln” in the\npassword. If your child’s name is “Johnny Cage” do not include “John”, “cage”,\n“jcage”, “johnnyc”, etc.\nPersonal information in a password only makes it easier for someone to guess it.\nAnd if someone is able to get into your account, it provides clues to other\ninformation about you, eventually leading to more identity theft. For example,\nyou all know me as a technical individual. If my password was “computer” it\nmakes it very easy for someone to guess it. But a password such as “DumDum12#”\ndoesn’t make sense to anyone.

Have a different password for every online account\n\nThat’s right. Do not have the same password for any of your online accounts.\nKeep each account password unique to itself. Believe it or not, this is not\ndifficult to do. Once you come up with a password, it should mark some type of \npattern  which will make it easy to create or change passwords in the future_._\nSomething that is even easier to do is make the password similar  but not the \nsame  as your other online accounts.

Most websites will not remind you to change\nyour password. They leave this task up to you.\n\n6. Make the passwords easy to type and easy to remember\n\nMake sure the password is easy to type and is easy for you to remember. One\nthing that helps are patterns.

I am just explaining things as I see it. If you are looking for IT Developer info, this article is not for you. Also, I am not going to talk one bit about IT management or specialized roles such as Exchange administrator or Datacenter Engineer. This article is all about the general stuff. If you are looking to break into an IT support career and continue to move up through the low-end (helpdesk) jobs to a more advanced position, then keep reading. \\nFrom what I have seen so far, there are 4 primary support-type positions in IT and 3 different primary professions to choose from. \\nTechnical Support Role #1 – Helpdesk, Service Desk and Desktop Support \\nTechnical Support Role #2 – Network Administration and Engineering \\nTechnical Support Role #3 – Server Administration and Engineering \\nTechnical Support Role #4 – Security Administration and Engineering \\nProfessional Career Track #1 – Network \\nProfessional Career Track #2 – Server \\nProfessional Career Track #3 – Security \\nStarting with #1, the helpdesk. This is your entry-level, tier 1, position and is a very good place to start your career. Helpdesk people are the ‘lackeys’, or the ones that do most of the grunt work. You learn many things in the helpdesk especially professionalism and customer service skills that are lacking in the IT industry. The cool thing about working on the helpdesk is that you get to dabble in several different areas of IT. Also, a very good thing about working the helpdesk is that you get to see how the business is managed. If you are very good on the helpdesk it is possible to upgrade to Desktop Support, which is a tier 2 position. Beyond Desktop Support, there is not much to move into without more schooling or certification. Helpdesk jobs are a dime a dozen. They are not hard to find. The bad thing about the helpdesk is that it has a very high turnover rate. Count on having at least 3 different helpdesk jobs at 3 different companies within a 5 year period. This will help gain you more experience, help you find a business that you would like to grow with, and help you make a decision on what IT career track you want to take – Network, Server, or Security Administration. \\nSome popular Certifications with this Technical Support Role: \\n\\nSome popular advanced certifications with this Technical Support Role: \\n\\nNumber 2, Network Administrator. A network administrator deals strictly with support-type issues related to, you guessed it, networking. This may or may not include working with the helpdesk, supporting and administering network devices, configuring routers and switches, dealing with IP telephony, and so on. There is not much ‘advancing’ in Network Administration. When you become a Netadmin, that is pretty much it. The reason is because most businesses consider Network Administration and Network Engineering the EXACT same thing. And if you have not already figured it out yet, networks don’t really change as dramatically as desktops or servers – that is unless you work for a telecom company. Don’t get me wrong though, Network Administration is a VERY lucrative and VERY profitable career. Just keep in mind that there is not much change with networks. Many netadmins start out on the helpdesk. When working the helpdesk they complete their schooling and get certified, then find some type of networking job. So sometimes there is some job hopping involved. The good news is that there are usually a good amount of Network Administrator jobs out there. The bad thing is that netadmin jobs tend to be short-term (think contract jobs) or have a medium turnover rate. Also, netadmins have to constantly get re-certified in the same technology just to stay current. It doesn’t matter if the technology has not changed, you just need to re-certify because most network certifications expire after 3 years. Becoming a certified network administrator guarantees marketability. If networking is “Your bag, baby!!!” then this is the career for you. \\nSome popular Certifications with this Technical Support Role: \\n\\nServer Administration and Engineering. Dealing with Servers is a very fun and very challenging task. In order to become a Server admin, experience is the key. You will need to have a huge amount of knowledge on the PC desktop, knowledge on a variety of PC and server hardware, knowledge of vendor specific server applications, virtualization, security, advanced or expert networking skills (possibly more than a Network Administrator would know), and business knowledge. It just is not possible to shoot straight into a Server admin role without proving your skills first. Usually, Server Admins are seasoned veterans of the IT profession and have a great deal of knowledge in almost every aspect of server, desktop, network, and IT security. Server Admins tend to be the ‘go to’ people, which makes them incredibly valuable – albeit expensive as well (which can be a burden on a company’s IT budget). It tends to be difficult to become a Server Admin. Usually you start at the helpdesk, then get promoted to Desktop Support. While in Desktop Support, you will obtain server certifications and continue to train or go back to college to get your B.A while you sit and wait for a Server Admin position to open up, which could take years. So like I said, it is very difficult to become a Server Admin. The only career path above a Server admin is getting into upper IT management. But if this is the career for you, don’t give up! The rewards far outweigh the heartache and pain in getting to this point. \\nSome popular Certifications with this Technical Support Role: \\n\\nSecurity Administrator keeps on flipping back and forth with network administration between the highest, or 2nd highest most sought after IT jobs in the world. I am not going to lie, I do not know much about Security Administration. But I do know that it is VERY high in demand. Count on performing a great deal of auditing and providing reports to management as a Security Administrator or IT Auditor. Sometimes, being having hacking skills help obtain a security-type position. Having a high-level of knowledge of networking or server engineering is not necessarily required to be a security administrator, but you DO need to know how networks and servers can be broken (security-related of course). Many people in the Security Administrator role jumped into these positions right after college, or after working as a Junior Network administrator or Junior Server administrator. Security is still a misunderstood area of IT that businesses tend to fall short on. If you choose this profession, it is possible to skyrocket into IT management very quickly. \\nSome popular Certifications with this Technical Support Role: \\n\\n[More information on the different IT security certifications](http://certification.about.com/od/securitycerts/a/seccertessentls.htm)\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Lets face it.

It isn’t easy trying to earn an IT professional job. It doesn’t\nmatter if you have just a certification or two, or just a college degree.\nNowadays you need to have at least a few certifications and a degree just to\nremain marketable. If you already have a certification, is it current? If you\nhave an MCSE in Windows 2000 it just doesn’t cut it any longer. You need to\nupgrade and keep your certifications current in addition to keeping up with\ncurrent technology. I hope to arm you with some important, critical, information\nabout what certification paths to take and how to obtain your goals.\n** DISCLAIMER: This article is of my own opinion after 4 years of working in\nvarious IT outfits. I am just explaining things as I see it. If you are looking\nfor IT Developer info, this article is not for you. Also, I am not going to talk\none bit about IT management or specialized roles such as Exchange administrator\nor Datacenter Engineer. This article is all about the general stuff. If you are\nlooking to break into an IT support career and continue to move up through the\nlow-end (helpdesk) jobs to a more advanced position, then keep reading.\nFrom what I have seen so far, there are 4 primary support-type positions in IT\nand 3 different primary professions to choose from.\nTechnical Support Role #1 – Helpdesk, Service Desk and Desktop Support\nTechnical Support Role #2 – Network Administration and Engineering\nTechnical Support Role #3 – Server Administration and Engineering\nTechnical Support Role #4 – Security Administration and Engineering\nProfessional Career Track #1 – Network\nProfessional Career Track #2 – Server\nProfessional Career Track #3 – Security\nStarting with #1, the helpdesk. This is your entry-level, tier 1, position and\nis a very good place to start your career. Helpdesk people are the ‘lackeys’, or\nthe ones that do most of the grunt work. You learn many things in the helpdesk\nespecially professionalism and customer service skills that are lacking in the\nIT industry. The cool thing about working on the helpdesk is that you get to\ndabble in several different areas of IT. Also, a very good thing about working\nthe helpdesk is that you get to see how the business is managed. If you are very\ngood on the helpdesk it is possible to upgrade to Desktop Support, which is a\ntier 2 position. Beyond Desktop Support, there is not much to move into without\nmore schooling or certification. Helpdesk jobs are a dime a dozen. They are not\nhard to find. The bad thing about the helpdesk is that it has a very high\nturnover rate. Count on having at least 3 different helpdesk jobs at 3 different\ncompanies within a 5 year period. This will help gain you more experience, help\nyou find a business that you would like to grow with, and help you make a\ndecision on what IT career track you want to take – Network, Server, or Security\nAdministration.\nSome popular Certifications with this Technical Support Role:\n\nSome popular advanced certifications with this Technical Support Role:\n\nNumber 2, Network Administrator. A network administrator deals strictly with\nsupport-type issues related to, you guessed it, networking. This may or may not\ninclude working with the helpdesk, supporting and administering network devices,\nconfiguring routers and switches, dealing with IP telephony, and so on. There is\nnot much ‘advancing’ in Network Administration. When you become a Netadmin, that\nis pretty much it. The reason is because most businesses consider Network\nAdministration and Network Engineering the EXACT same thing. And if you have not\nalready figured it out yet, networks don’t really change as dramatically as\ndesktops or servers – that is unless you work for a telecom company. Don’t get\nme wrong though, Network Administration is a VERY lucrative and VERY profitable\ncareer. Just keep in mind that there is not much change with networks. Many\nnetadmins start out on the helpdesk. When working the helpdesk they complete\ntheir schooling and get certified, then find some type of networking job. So\nsometimes there is some job hopping involved. The good news is that there are\nusually a good amount of Network Administrator jobs out there. The bad thing is\nthat netadmin jobs tend to be short-term (think contract jobs) or have a medium\nturnover rate. Also, netadmins have to constantly get re-certified in the same\ntechnology just to stay current. It doesn’t matter if the technology has not\nchanged, you just need to re-certify because most network certifications expire\nafter 3 years. Becoming a certified network administrator guarantees\nmarketability. If networking is “Your bag, baby!!!” then this is the career for\nyou.\nSome popular Certifications with this Technical Support Role:\n\nServer Administration and Engineering. Dealing with Servers is a very fun and\nvery challenging task. In order to become a Server admin, experience is the key.\nYou will need to have a huge amount of knowledge on the PC desktop, knowledge on\na variety of PC and server hardware, knowledge of vendor specific server\napplications, virtualization, security, advanced or expert networking skills\n(possibly more than a Network Administrator would know), and business knowledge.\nIt just is not possible to shoot straight into a Server admin role without\nproving your skills first. Usually, Server Admins are seasoned veterans of the\nIT profession and have a great deal of knowledge in almost every aspect of\nserver, desktop, network, and IT security. Server Admins tend to be the ‘go to’\npeople, which makes them incredibly valuable – albeit expensive as well (which\ncan be a burden on a company’s IT budget). It tends to be difficult to become a\nServer Admin. Usually you start at the helpdesk, then get promoted to Desktop\nSupport. While in Desktop Support, you will obtain server certifications and\ncontinue to train or go back to college to get your B.A while you sit and wait\nfor a Server Admin position to open up, which could take years. So like I said,\nit is very difficult to become a Server Admin. The only career path above a\nServer admin is getting into upper IT management. But if this is the career for\nyou, don’t give up! The rewards far outweigh the heartache and pain in getting\nto this point.\nSome popular Certifications with this Technical Support Role:\n\nSecurity Administrator keeps on flipping back and forth with network\nadministration between the highest, or 2nd highest most sought after IT jobs in\nthe world. I am not going to lie, I do not know much about Security\nAdministration. But I do know that it is VERY high in demand. Count on\nperforming a great deal of auditing and providing reports to management as a\nSecurity Administrator or IT Auditor. Sometimes, being having hacking skills\nhelp obtain a security-type position. Having a high-level of knowledge of\nnetworking or server engineering is not necessarily required to be a security\nadministrator, but you DO need to know how networks and servers can be broken\n(security-related of course). Many people in the Security Administrator role\njumped into these positions right after college, or after working as a Junior\nNetwork administrator or Junior Server administrator. Security is still a\nmisunderstood area of IT that businesses tend to fall short on. If you choose\nthis profession, it is possible to skyrocket into IT management very quickly.\nSome popular Certifications with this Technical Support Role:\n\nMore information on the different IT security certifications\n[http://certification.about.com/od/securitycerts/a/seccertessentls.htm]","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2010-11-15T22:31:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2011-08-29T14:16:28.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2010-11-15T22:31:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc7f5","uuid":"0b2e21d3-012c-4a6d-94c1-aa1a5795c376","title":"The Secrets of Troubleshooting","slug":"the_secrets_of_troubleshooting","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"It doesn’t matter if the problem affects one person on one computer or an entire facility.![](http://cdn2.knowyourmeme.com/i/31766/original/troubleshooting-funny-troubleshooting-windows-pwns-mac-pc-aw-demotivational-poster-1227942134.jpg?1261501977) The fact of the matter is that a great PC administrator is also a great troubleshooter. Want to know my secrets of troubleshooting? Read on my friends! \\n**<u>Secret #1 – Know how it works</u>**. If you know how things work you can better determine the cause of a problem or get things up and running much quicker. Lets say you are troubleshooting a problem on a computer for a user. They are having an issue with an application that no one else is using, no one else knows anything about, and no one else has any information on. What do you do in this case? Well, one of the things that is a great start is finding out how it works. Starting here is perfect and leads you to more obvious questions such as “How is the program installed?”, “How is the program used?”, or even “Is this the latest version of the program?”. As you can see, finding out how something actually works is often completely overlooked by many tech support personnel when they are stumped on an issue. Going back to the basics and finding out how something works will help not only to get to the bottom of a problem, but it will expand your knowledge and experience.

Research is the heart of troubleshooting in general. If you do not know how to fix a problem, or don’t know how something works, you need to research and find out on your own. In my opinion, those that do not wish to research simply do not care or do not wish to learn and expand their knowledge. This is a dangerous situation to have especially in the tech support area as it displays carelessness and laziness. Knowledge is key. Always remember that “Google is your friend”. \\n**<u>Secret #3 – Share the knowledge.</u>** Sharing knowledge is key in the tech support business. A common belief amongst tech support people is that if they hold the knowledge in their heads, it increases their job security because they are the only ones that knows the info. But withholding knowledge hurts everyone including your co-workers, the users you support, and even the business you support. Think of it this way, what if internet search engines never existed? What if Google said, “Oh, well I know this information but I don’t want to share it.” It would be almost impossible to find information quickly and efficiently wouldn’t it? The internet would almost cease to exist without search engines. Sharing knowledge helps improve some of your basic communication and writing skills and can even help to improve your work ethic and credibility as a tech support employee. Sharing knowledge can be as simple has having a network share with word documents, or can be a Sharepoint site, or even a knowledgebase application. Just remember to write down that knowledge and store it in a safe place for everyone to share. \\nSo, out of this entire article, what do you think the theme of troubleshooting comprises of? **Knowledge**! \\nI hope you gain some important _knowledge_ out of this article and that is serves as a reminder for your future troubleshooting situations!\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>It doesn’t matter if the problem affects one person on one computer or an entire facility.<img src=\"http://cdn2.knowyourmeme.com/i/31766/original/troubleshooting-funny-troubleshooting-windows-pwns-mac-pc-aw-demotivational-poster-1227942134.jpg?1261501977\" alt=\"\"> The fact of the matter is that a great PC administrator is also a great troubleshooter.

Your welcome. \\nFor the first edition of this series, I have decided to create a USB boot disk for something special…… VMWare ESXi 4.0\\\\. This came about when I didn’t have a DVD burner to burn the downloadable ISO file to a DVD. \\n****DISCLAIMER: \\nI want to be very clear about this article. This article does NOT explain how to install the VMWare hypervisor ON a USB drive or TO a USB drive. It explains only how to make a bootable USB drive as a bootable VMWare disk in order to install VMWare ESXi on a hard drive in a compatible computer. The USB drive will work just as if you booted a computer from the VMWare DVD. Lets get started, shall we? \\nFirst, some rules and guidelines about this entire process. These instructions are for creating the USB drive from a Windows 7 64 bit computer (no offense to Linux gurus). Unless you have User Account Control disabled, be sure to launch all programs using “Run As Administrator” (hold SHIFT and right-click on the file to see Run As Administrator appear in the context menu). If you disabled User Account Control in Vista or Windows 7, then you have nothing to worry about. These instructions only work with VMWare ESX or ESXi versions 4.0 or 4.0 Update 1\\\\. This WILL NOT WORK with VMWare ESX or ESXi 4.1\\\\. There is some strange hardware issue with v4.1 where it ‘forgets’ where the boot media is after you have selected a SATA hard drive to install the software to. I think this is due to the fact that VMWare is starting to force administrators to purchase hardware that is on the official VMWare Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) for support reasons. It doesn’t matter though. After you have installed 4.0 or 4.0 Update 1 on the target computer you can upgrade to 4.1. \\nYou will need 3 things to get started…. \\n\\n1. USB drive at least 512mb in size.\\n2. Copy of the VMWare ESX or ESXi 4.0 Update 1 Installable ISO file.\\n3. Copy of Multiboot ISOs USB Creator from [www.pendrivelinux.com](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/boot-multiple-iso-from-usb-multiboot-usb/)\\n\\nAfter you have retrieved all of the items listed above, here is exactly what to do: \\n\\n1. Launch Multiboot ISOs USB Creator as an administrator.\\n2. Click “agree” at the EULA, click NO when prompted if you want to try the experimental version.\\n3. Select your USB drive, check the box to format the drive, highlight “MemTest86+”, check the box to download the ISO, then click the “Create” button (screenshot of the options you need to make is below): \\n\\n[![image](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wrT9VW078bU/TICMNOeJ0CI/AAAAAAAAATE/G-MOlnPP8fE/image_thumb%5B5%5D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wrT9VW078bU/TICML10j--I/AAAAAAAAATA/w4O-CnTvtRc/s1600-h/image%5B9%5D.png)\\n4. When the program has complete, click Next, then NO if asked to add more distros. Click Finish to close the program.\\n5. Navigate to the root of the USB disk in Windows Explorer (you will notice that the volume name is “MULTIBOOT”).\\n6. Copy the VMWare ESXi ISO file directly to the root of the multiboot USB drive.\\n7. Rename the ISO to “VMWARE40.ISO”.\\n8. Open the MENU.LST file in a text editor.\\n9. Paste this text EXACTLY as it is shown below at the end of the file and save it: \\n\\n_**title VMWare \\n\\nfind --set-root /vmware40.iso \\n\\nmap --mem /vmware40.iso (hd32) \\n\\nmap --hook \\n\\nroot (hd32) \\n\\nchainloader (hd32)**_\\n10. Safely remove the USB drive from the Windows computer.\\n11. Boot your target computer from the newly created USB drive.\\n12. At the boot menu, select VMWare and wait a moment.\\n13. The VMWare installation menu will appear.\\n14. Done.\\n\\nSo what happened after the computer boots to the USB drive? A menu displayed with the bootable ISOs in the list. At this time there are 2\\\\. One is the MemTest tool, the other is VMWare. You chose the VMWare selection and hit enter. The bootloader created a temporary RAM drive, copied the ISO file to the RAM drive, then booted the ISO directly from RAM. Since the entire ISO image is loaded directly into RAM, you will notice that the VMWare installation completes extremely fast. When the computer reboots, the RAM drive is lost and proceeds to boot ESX normally. Pretty slick, huh? \\n[![image](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wrT9VW078bU/TICMNOeJ0CI/AAAAAAAAAS8/2TD04mCDges/image_thumb%5B3%5D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wrT9VW078bU/TICML10j--I/AAAAAAAAAS0/fDQVwzVbDHE/s1600-h/image%5B7%5D.png)\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Bootable USB drives are a great thing.

You can easily upgrade the software on a\nUSB drive, wipe out the drive, or replace it. Heck, even most USB flash drives\ncan get run through a washer AND dryer and STILL work! So with this in mind, I\nhave decided to start a run of posts that go over the creation of various USB\nboot disks! Your welcome.\nFor the first edition of this series, I have decided to create a USB boot disk\nfor something special…… VMWare ESXi 4.0. This came about when I didn’t have a\nDVD burner to burn the downloadable ISO file to a DVD.\n****DISCLAIMER:\nI want to be very clear about this article. This article does NOT explain how to\ninstall the VMWare hypervisor ON a USB drive or TO a USB drive. It explains only\nhow to make a bootable USB drive as a bootable VMWare disk in order to install\nVMWare ESXi on a hard drive in a compatible computer. The USB drive will work\njust as if you booted a computer from the VMWare DVD. Lets get started, shall\nwe?\nFirst, some rules and guidelines about this entire process. These instructions\nare for creating the USB drive from a Windows 7 64 bit computer (no offense to\nLinux gurus). Unless you have User Account Control disabled, be sure to launch\nall programs using “Run As Administrator” (hold SHIFT and right-click on the\nfile to see Run As Administrator appear in the context menu). If you disabled\nUser Account Control in Vista or Windows 7, then you have nothing to worry\nabout. These instructions only work with VMWare ESX or ESXi versions 4.0 or 4.0\nUpdate 1. This WILL NOT WORK with VMWare ESX or ESXi 4.1. There is some strange\nhardware issue with v4.1 where it ‘forgets’ where the boot media is after you\nhave selected a SATA hard drive to install the software to. I think this is due\nto the fact that VMWare is starting to force administrators to purchase hardware\nthat is on the official VMWare Hardware Compatibility List (HCL) for support\nreasons. It doesn’t matter though. After you have installed 4.0 or 4.0 Update 1\non the target computer you can upgrade to 4.1.\nYou will need 3 things to get started….\n\n 1. USB drive at least 512mb in size.\n 2. Copy of the VMWare ESX or ESXi 4.0 Update 1 Installable ISO file.\n 3. Copy of Multiboot ISOs USB Creator from www.pendrivelinux.com\n    [http://www.pendrivelinux.com/boot-multiple-iso-from-usb-multiboot-usb/]\n\nAfter you have retrieved all of the items listed above, here is exactly what to\ndo:\n\n 1. Launch Multiboot ISOs USB Creator as an administrator.\n 2. Click “agree” at the EULA, click NO when prompted if you want to try the\n    experimental version.\n 3. Select your USB drive, check the box to format the drive, highlight\n    “MemTest86+”, check the box to download the ISO, then click the “Create”\n    button (screenshot of the options you need to make is below):\n\n \n[http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wrT9VW078bU/TICML10j--I/AAAAAAAAATA/w4O-CnTvtRc/s1600-h/image%5B9%5D.png]\n4. When the program has complete, click Next, then NO if asked to add more\ndistros. Click Finish to close the program.\n5. Navigate to the root of the USB disk in Windows Explorer (you will notice\nthat the volume name is “MULTIBOOT”).\n6. Copy the VMWare ESXi ISO file directly to the root of the multiboot USB\ndrive.\n7. Rename the ISO to “VMWARE40.ISO”.\n8. Open the MENU.LST file in a text editor.\n9. Paste this text EXACTLY as it is shown below at the end of the file and save\nit:\n\n_**title VMWare\n\nfind --set-root /vmware40.iso\n\nmap --mem /vmware40.iso (hd32)\n\nmap --hook\n\nroot (hd32)\n\nchainloader (hd32)**_\n10. Safely remove the USB drive from the Windows computer.\n11. Boot your target computer from the newly created USB drive.\n12. At the boot menu, select VMWare and wait a moment.\n13. The VMWare installation menu will appear.\n14. Done.\n\nSo what happened after the computer boots to the USB drive? A menu displayed\nwith the bootable ISOs in the list. At this time there are 2.

Congratulations! But, why on Earth![](http://hasqwq.blu.livefilestore.com/y1p8RheWGV5xWXwj2Pkf2ZPQUgbBFUI5pR9eOTLDT_W7q4lQRaftE2-W1_2xIhsa1vAyAT1xJSN430M5_EhZHlorqTisefY8ZKz/MDT-wheel.jpg) would you want to convert your old images and dump it into the new solution? Also, how do you take your current images and add them into Windows Deployment Services or the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit? \\n\\nThe primary reason why you would want to keep your old images is for archive and reference reasons. Also, maybe you require more than one image per hardware model or employee role. Whatever the reason, you know that you just need to keep your images. \\n\\nAnother reason to move to the new WIM image format is because of how GHO images are built. GHO images are sector based, while WIM images are file based which allows you to shrink captured images by up to 80%. WIM images also allow you to service the images offline; GHO images do not (at least not easily…).With WIM images, it is easier to service the images offline instead of being forced to recapture the image all over again. Think of a WIM like a large ZIP file.  You can unpack a ZIP file, change or add or remove a few things, then repackage the ZIP file all in one sitting. Now think of GHO images like an EXE file. You can’t edit the EXE’s contents and if you could, you can’t do it easily. The EXE file needs to be recreated all over again. The WIM format makes it easier to service images without having to go through an entire process to make a simple or small change. And did I mention that the Microsoft tools are free while Symantec’s software is not? Think about it :) \\n\\nNow, there are several requirements in order to capture a WIM image. First, the computer must be prepared using the System Preparation Tool (sysprep) and must be in a shutdown state. No reboots after sysprep has been executed or you will need to run sysprep again. Make sure the computer is 100% turned off. If you prepared your Ghost images correctly, your deployment images should already be sysprepped. Second, you need to boot the computer into the WinPE environment. You can do this by setting up a Windows Deployment Services server and configuring PXEBOOT options, or you can build a bootable ISO using the Windows AIK, or you can use the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit to build a deployment share and create bootable ISO images and PXEBOOT network images. And finally, you can only capture WIM images for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2008 operating systems. \\n\\nI will explain the general steps that I took in order to convert my current Ghost images to WIM: \\n\\n1. Deploy one of your Ghost images to a computer. When imaging is complete power off the computer. Do not reboot and do not allow the computer to boot into Windows. \\n\\nSo what have we done here? We simply deployed one of the sysprepped GHO images to the hard drive of a target computer. We have also NOT rebooted this computer. It is turned off. Why only turn it off? Because after first boot, Windows will apply the settings defined from running the System Preparation Tool (called Mini-Setup) and boot into Windows for the first time. Because capturing a WIM image requires that the computer has been sysprepped and must be in an unused state, we must leave the computer turned off. \\n\\n**If your Ghost images are not sysprepped, this is not a problem. Simply deploy the Ghost image, boot the computer into Windows for the first time, run sysprep and shut the computer down.\\n2. Turn on the computer and immediately boot into your WinPE boot environment without allowing Windows XP to boot for the first time. \\n\\nAgain, what is the purpose of this? Doesn't booting the computer allow mini-setup to run? No it does not. See, we are not booting the computer to the hard drive that has the Windows image on it. We are booting the computer into the WinPE environment bypassing the hard disk boot. This leaves the hard disk in an unused state, which is a requirement to capture a WIM image.\\n3. Capture the image in WinPE and store it in your imaging solution. \\n\\nNow, while inside of WinPE we can now capture the image using ImageX, or Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, or Windows Deployment Services. It all depends on how you have your imaging environment set up. I like to use a Windows 7 Capture Image that I created in Windows Deployment Services, boot to the network, and select the Capture Image from the network boot menu. The Capture Image is a customized boot image that does only one job; Boot into WinPE and launch the Capture Image tool. Like I said in my disclaimer at the top of this article, I cannot tell you how to prepare your environment for imaging. But if you contact me via email (joe@joedissmeyer.com), I would be happy to help you out.\\n4. Done.\\n\\nWell that sounds easy, right?! Maybe a little, but most of it should not. This is just a simple overview of the process. It is truly up to you to understand exactly what is going on during and after the entire deployment process. Your next steps as a Deployment Administrator would be to test every captured WIM image by deploying them and making sure they all work as expected. Remember, Google it or Bing it!

For example, in places where patient data is at risk of being stolen the Health Information Privacy Act (HIPPA) requires that computers have a reasonable form of protecting patient data. That reasonable form of protection is almost always 100% done by encryption. But here is the problem: Windows XP is still the most widely deployed operating system and Windows XP does not include a ‘reasonable’ form of data encryption (regardless of how much Microsoft may argue this fact, I am correct in this statement). So what is an IT administrator to do? Install 3rd party encryption software.\\n\\nMy current employer requires for full disk encryption software be set up and installed on all desktop and laptop computers. We use Checkpoint Pointsec Full Disk Encryption to encrypt the entire drive.

Support calls flow into the helpdesk or Service Desk primarily due to a lack of planning. And planning, ladies and gentleman, SHOULD BE your primary concern when expecting to implement new technology in the corporate environment. Now, of course, I don't intend to generalize my ideas on every single admin because I KNOW my statements to not apply to every single one of them. But in my experience, 90% of the admins I have had to deal with have this mentality, which I do not appreciate. Anyways, on with the point of my post....\\n\\nWith new versions of software, especially in Microsoft's case, the software developer usually makes changes to how the software works, or how security functions in the new software, and brings new compatibility issues with current client or server designs. Cases in point, Internet Explorer 7 and 8, Office 2007, and Windows 7\\\\.\\n\\nProblem #1: I received a phone call from a user that is getting annoyed with Internet Explorer 8 on their Windows 7 computer because it keeps on asking for his user credentials even though it is an intranet site (for this example lets say the site is site1.contoso.local). I used a remote tool to take control of his windows session and I added the website as a trusted site in the Internet Sites list. Even though I did that, IE still asked for credentials. So instead, I added the site as a trusted Intranet (not Internet) site, which IE prompted me that if I wanted to continue it would move the site to the intranet sites from the trusted internet sites. Obviously I clicked OK. Now that the intranet site opens just fine they tried to open a Word doc hosted on the page, but when opening the document, Microsoft Word 2007 was demanding credentials to view the file! The user made the changes he wanted then saved, but Word 2007 again asked to save the file. That is 3 logins just to do his work! Not worrying about the Word 2007 login annoyance, I continued looking at the problems this user was experiencing. Now the user wanted to go to another intranet site such as site2.contoso.local, IE prompted for credentials again.

See below....\n\nA user is at a remote site. The computer she is using belongs our domain. When\nshe logs into the computer it uses local cached credentials. The user logs into\nthe computer with the cached credentials (which is an old password) then use the\nCisco VPN client to connect to our network (using the CURRENT network password).\nAfter connecting to VPN she would double-click on a desktop shortcut that points\nto her My Documents network folder in order to access her files. Still with me?\nGood.\n\nThe user just got back from vacation and  tried to access her files just like\nany other day, but it wasn't working. What happened is that after she tried to\nopen her My Documents from the desktop shortcut she was presented with a Logon\nCredentials window. She would enter her username and password then press OK, but\nanother Logon Credentials window would open. Adding to the confusion, we found\nthat every time she entered her credentials and hit OK at the login box her\ndomain account would lock out.\n\nWe couldn't figure out what the heck was going on. After being on the phone with\nher for an hour, we finally figured out the cause of the problem. The issue must\nhave been due to corrupt or incorrect cached credentials on the computer.\n\nWe re-synced the workstation's cached credentials with the domain. You can\nfollow these steps on Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7:\n\n 1. We ensured the computer was connected to the network through VPN.\n 2. Click on Start > Control Panel\n 3. Open System > Computer Name tab > Network ID\n\n * In Windows Vista or 7, Open System, click on \"Change Settings\" under the\n   Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings, then click on Network ID.\n\n 4.  The Network Identification Wizard opens. Click next.\n 5.  Choose the first bullet point and click next.\n 6.  Choose the first bullet point and click next.\n 7.  Read the Network Information screen and click next.\n 8.  Type your domain user account information and click next.\n 9.  At the \"This computer name has been found on the domain. Use this\n     computer?\" click Yes.\n 10. Keep clicking next and the sync process will occur. You will need to reboot\n     the PC.\n 11. After reboot, log in with the CURRENT network credentials.\n\nAfter re-syncing her cached credentials with the network, the user was able to\naccess her My Documents just as she was able to in the past. Apparently it is\nrare when Windows somehow gets the cached credentials corrupted or incorrect,\nbut it can happen. Keep this one in your knowledgebase just in case you\nencounter a similar issue.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2010-05-20T16:03:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2011-08-29T14:17:23.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2010-05-20T16:03:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc809","uuid":"70d6f752-2f54-45d0-86c8-9e185e6f2f22","title":"Tools and Resources for the Programmer in Training","slug":"tools_and_resources_for_the_programmer_in_training","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Programming is not like it was 10 years ago.

This guide works for Logstash v5.x but will most likely work for future versions as well.\\n\\nThe purpose of running Logstash on a local workstation is for testing filter configurations before adding them to a production Logstash instance. With that being said, there are a few pre-requisites for running Logstash in general:\\n\\n1. Windows fully updated.\\n2. [Oracle Java Development Kit v8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) (1.8.x) installed. It must be the JDK, not the Java Runtime (JRE).\\n\\nMost IT pros are pretty new to Logstash so I'll walk through setting up the JDK since there are a few special steps to get it working correctly in Windows.\\n\\n### Configuring JDK in Windows\\n\\n1. Download and install [Oracle Java Development Kit v8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). Choose all defaults.\\n2. Click Start, search for \\\"Environment Variables\\\" and open the system properties applet. The advanced tab of the \\\"System Properties\\\" applet should appear.\\n3. Click the Environment Variables button.\\n4. Under System variables click \\\"New\\\".\\n5. Enter the variable name \\\"JAVA_HOME\\\" (without quotes) and browse to the JDK install directory and click OK. It will look like this: \\n![jdk](/content/images/2017/11/jdk.png)\\n\\nThe JDK is now installed and good to go. Next, Logstash.\\n\\n### First Time Install and Setup of Logstash\\n\\nLet's download and install Logstash.\\n\\n1. Download the Logstash ZIP package from here - https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash.\\n2. Extract the ZIP contents to a local folder. For this example I will extract the contents to C:\\\\logstash\\\\\\n\\nThat's it! Logstash is installed.... ok well you still need to configure it but it will run. At this point Logstash can be started from the command line or from Powershell.\\n\\nRunning logstash is extremely simple. All that is needed is a config file that contains at least one input and at least one output.\\n\\nBelow is an example configuration to get started. Logstash will accept input from the console as a message, will process it (if a filter is provided), then will output to the console in JSON.\\n\\nCreate a blank file in C:\\\\logstash\\\\bin\\\\logstash.conf.\\nUse this as a sample to get started with your own Logstash config:\\n\\n```\\ninput {\\n    # Accept input from the console.\\n    stdin{}\\n}\\n\\nfilter {\\n    # Add filter here. This sample has a blank filter.\\n}\\n\\noutput {\\n    # Output to the console.\\n    stdout {\\n            codec => \\\"rubydebug\\\"\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n##### Running Logstash from the shell\\n\\nTo start Logstash, run the batch file with the -f flag and define the location of the conf file.\\nFor example, execute this from Powershell:\\n\\n```\\nc:\\\\logstash\\\\bin\\\\logstash.bat -f c:\\\\logstash\\\\bin\\\\logstash.conf\\n```\\n\\nTo stop Logstash simply press CTRL+C to stop the running process.\\n\\n### Installing Logstash as a Windows service\\n\\nDownload the Non-Sucking Service Manager (NSSM) from http://nssm.cc.\\n\\nExtract the EXE to the BIN directory of the Logstash location.\\n\\nNavigate to the logstash BIN directory, execute the following from the shell:\\n\\n```\\n.\\\\nssm.exe install logstash\\n```\\n\\n- Path: full path of where the LOGSTASH.BAT file is located. For example D:\\\\elastic\\\\logstash\\\\bin\\\\logstash.bat.\\n- Startup Directory: full path of the BIN directory. For example D:\\\\elastic\\\\logstash\\\\bin\\\\\\n- Arguments: Include the '-f' flag with the path of the logstash config file. For example, \\\"-f d:\\\\elastic\\\\logstash\\\\bin\\\\logstash.conf\\\" (without quotes).\\n- On the details tab ensure the service is set to start up automatically.\\n- Also on the details tab, ensure the service is set to use a service account. This is especially important in highly secure or AD-DS environments.\\n- Click \\\"Install Service\\\".\\n\\nStart the service.\\n\\n### Resources:\\n\\nInstalling Logstash (official documentation) - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/installing-logstash.html\\n\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Let's talk about how to run Logstash on Windows.</p>\n<p>I've been playing around with the Elastic Stack for quite a while now and it is a great tool.

Not only is it the search platform for several large companies, it\nis extremely useful for analyzing pretty much any type of data that you want -\nlike application logs (one of it's non-search use cases).\n\nThis article describes the process for how to install Logstash on a Windows\nworkstation or Windows server. The installation concepts for Logstash are the\nsame on both desktop and server however in Windows server you will want to run\nLogstash as a service (covered at the end). This guide works for Logstash v5.x\nbut will most likely work for future versions as well.\n\nThe purpose of running Logstash on a local workstation is for testing filter\nconfigurations before adding them to a production Logstash instance. With that\nbeing said, there are a few pre-requisites for running Logstash in general:\n\n 1. Windows fully updated.\n 2. Oracle Java Development Kit v8\n    [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html] \n     (1.8.x) installed. It must be the JDK, not the Java Runtime (JRE).\n\nMost IT pros are pretty new to Logstash so I'll walk through setting up the JDK\nsince there are a few special steps to get it working correctly in Windows.\n\nConfiguring JDK in Windows\n 1. Download and install Oracle Java Development Kit v8\n    [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html]\n    . Choose all defaults.\n 2. Click Start, search for \"Environment Variables\" and open the system\n    properties applet. The advanced tab of the \"System Properties\" applet should\n    appear.\n 3. Click the Environment Variables button.\n 4. Under System variables click \"New\".\n 5. Enter the variable name \"JAVA_HOME\" (without quotes) and browse to the JDK\n    install directory and click OK. It will look like this:\n    \n\nThe JDK is now installed and good to go. Next, Logstash.\n\nFirst Time Install and Setup of Logstash\nLet's download and install Logstash.\n\n 1. Download the Logstash ZIP package from here - \n    https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash.\n 2. Extract the ZIP contents to a local folder. For this example I will extract\n    the contents to C:\\logstash\\\n\nThat's it! Logstash is installed.... ok well you still need to configure it but\nit will run. At this point Logstash can be started from the command line or from\nPowershell.\n\nRunning logstash is extremely simple. All that is needed is a config file that\ncontains at least one input and at least one output.\n\nBelow is an example configuration to get started. Logstash will accept input\nfrom the console as a message, will process it (if a filter is provided), then\nwill output to the console in JSON.\n\nCreate a blank file in C:\\logstash\\bin\\logstash.conf.\nUse this as a sample to get started with your own Logstash config:\n\ninput {\n    # Accept input from the console.\n    stdin{}\n}\n\nfilter {\n    # Add filter here. This sample has a blank filter.\n}\n\noutput {\n    # Output to the console.\n    stdout {\n            codec => \"rubydebug\"\n    }\n}\n\n\nRunning Logstash from the shell\nTo start Logstash, run the batch file with the -f flag and define the location\nof the conf file.\nFor example, execute this from Powershell:\n\nc:\\logstash\\bin\\logstash.bat -f c:\\logstash\\bin\\logstash.conf\n\n\nTo stop Logstash simply press CTRL+C to stop the running process.\n\nInstalling Logstash as a Windows service\nDownload the Non-Sucking Service Manager (NSSM) from http://nssm.cc.\n\nExtract the EXE to the BIN directory of the Logstash location.\n\nNavigate to the logstash BIN directory, execute the following from the shell:\n\n.\\nssm.exe install logstash\n\n\n * Path: full path of where the LOGSTASH.BAT file is located. For example\n   D:\\elastic\\logstash\\bin\\logstash.bat.\n * Startup Directory: full path of the BIN directory. For example\n   D:\\elastic\\logstash\\bin\\\n * Arguments: Include the '-f' flag with the path of the logstash config file.\n   For example, \"-f d:\\elastic\\logstash\\bin\\logstash.conf\" (without quotes).\n * On the details tab ensure the service is set to start up automatically.\n * Also on the details tab, ensure the service is set to use a service account.\n   This is especially important in highly secure or AD-DS environments.\n * Click \"Install Service\".\n\nStart the service.\n\nResources:\nInstalling Logstash (official documentation) - \nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/installing-logstash.html","feature_image":"/content/images/2017/11/logstash_violet.png","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2017-11-12T03:12:12.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2017-11-12T03:59:14.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2017-11-12T03:49:06.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"Let's talk about how to run Logstash on Windows.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc812","uuid":"af35b686-363b-4f01-8dce-026fe921d849","title":"Relaxing tunes from the Chrono Series Games","slug":"enjoy-tunes-chrono-trigger","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"52 minutes of pure music awesomeness from Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H0uIRTmRlZI\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nI'm listening to these musical masterpieces by Yasunori Mitsuda and Nobuo Uematsu while working on writing tonight and it just makes me want to stop and play Chrono Trigger.\\n\\nIf you've never played Chrono Trigger or Chrono Cross go do it right now if you can.

It is using us.\\n\\nIn the beginning, social media as a platform was an amazing thing. In the first days of MySpace, Friendster, Twitter, or Facebook (the list goes on) it brought people together. It made it possible to re-connect with family members that seemed to have been forgotten. It allowed you to connect with friends or co-workers from long ago. And it helped to bring some people together that you never would have thought shared the same values or ideas. This in itself is an amazing thing!\\n\\nIn the beginning, social media platforms brought people together.\\n\\nAnd very quickly, it became the new \\\"public square\\\". \\n\\nSocial media was optimistic, democratic, civil, and it allowed people to be somewhat anonymous. It was considered a \\\"safe place\\\" to share your thoughts, opinions, disappointments, wins or losses. It was simple and possible to share life experiences and ideas in an assumed *safe place* with others that shared the same values as you did.\\n\\nBut over time something happened. Something changed for the worse.\\n\\nThe controversial issues started to be discussed openly in the public square. And in the beginning it wasn't a big deal.\\nIn the beginning there was this universal understanding that if one had a disagreement with a topic that it was ok to simply disagree, move on, and discuss topics that they did share the same values with.\\n\\nBut over time, those that were originally open to having honest and civil discussions about these topics started getting responses from those that disagreed.\\nAnd very quickly those responses started to get dark.\\nThose that simply disagreed on opposing points of view quickly started to move past the point of deadlock, and the attacks started.\\n\\nAt first, the attacks were subtle and individual.\\nBut then the attacks escalated to entire groups and sub-cultures.\\nThen after the attacks came the public shaming.\\nThen after the shaming came the trolls, with the goal of complete annihilation.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nIsn't it interesting that we all inherently *know* that it is not possible for anyone else to be EXACTLY like us?\\nAnd that every person on this planet, both young and old, through their own personal experience encounter many others that do not have the same ideas that they do?\\n\\nWe all KNOW that it is not possible for someone else to be EXACTLY like us. \\n\\nWe all KNOW that people do NOT think exactly the way that we do, nor in the way that we do. \\n\\nWe all KNOW that everyone has their own individual way of learning, their own individual way of thinking, their own individual way of logic, and their own unique formed worldview.\\n\\nBut when we discover that someone else thinks differently than us, we are taken aback and are absolutely stunned by it.\\n\\nWhen it comes to controversial topics (i.e. marriage, abortion, faith) somehow most of us begin to convince ourselves that it is our job to convert them to our point of view. That, \\\"By any means necessary these people must see the light! They need to be rescued from the dark side!\\\" We convince ourselves that ONLY we are the rational ones and those that have a difference of opinion are *absolutely* irrational.\\n\\nBut we don't call them irrational.\\n\\nWith those that we are unable to convert to our way of thinking, or for those that we cannot seem to 'get on our side', we start making accusations. We try to break them down by attacking their humanity. The name calling starts and escalates quickly.\\n\\nWe call them stupid.\\n\\nWe call them despicable.\\n\\nWe call them racist.\\n\\nWe call them retarded.\\n\\nWe call them crazy.\\n\\nThen we call them insane.\\n\\nFor some reason, over time we convince ourselves that people with whom we have an impasse with need to be shamed out of existence. We convince ourselves that these people, simply because they are different than ourselves, need to be destroyed.\\n\\nAnd we justify all of this in the name of \\\"social justice\\\".\\n\\nBut is this really justice?\\nIs this really democratic?\\nDoes this behavior truly help our cause and goal?\\n\\nI think not.\\n\\nIt is a very human thing to de-humanize the people we hurt.\\nWe want to destroy people and not feel bad about it.\\n\\nSome of us think that our hurtful communication towards another individual or group over social media is justified.\\n\\nCommunication is one of the social aspects of being human.\\n\\nHumans are all designed for social activity and we cannot survive without being social. Everything us humans do is social.\\n\\nWe decieve ourselves into believing that social media feeds our social needs as humans. That somehow, life happens on social media so we need to be connected as much as possible.\\n\\nThis couldn't be more false.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nSocial media, to put it plainly, is *addictive*.\\n\\nIt is engineered to be addictive.\\nIt is engineered to be as habit-forming as crystal meth.\\nIt is engineered to try to *make* you rely on it to survive.\\n\\nDo you not believe me? Do you not believe that social media is engineered to be addictive?\\n\\nHere is one example.\\n\\nWatch this CNET interview between Jerry Seinfeld and Mark Zuckerberg (start at 1:17).... https://youtu.be/ZFZWae4bmIw?t=1m17s\\n\\nThis is a fascinating interview!\\n\\nJerry asks Mark what the first thing that Mark does in the morning right after he wakes up. Mark answers, \\\"I check my phone.\\\" But he only uses the restroom only AFTER checking his phone.\\n\\n- If you you wake up in the morning and the *very first thing you do* is check your phone, you are addicted.\\n- If you walk all over your house room to room with your phone in your pocket, you are addicted.\\n- If you are out with your friends and you are texting someone not in your group, you are addicted.\\n- If you text WHILE you are driving your car, you are addicted.\\n- If you are with your spouse on the couch and you are texting them while they are *SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU*, you are addicted.\\n\\nScience has proven time and time again that for those whom are addicted to something, that when difficulties happen, and when significant stress happens in their lives, instead of turning to a person they turn to their addiction to cope.\\n\\nIn the case of social media addicts, when stress occurs, these addicts turn to a device, they turn to Facebook or Twitter. All of which offers only temporary relief.\\n\\n**Addictions are NOT a good thing.**\\n\\nAccording to the Marriam-Webster dictionary, the definition of [addiction](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/addicted) is \\\"strongly inclined or compelled to do, use, or indulge in something repeatedly\\\".\\n\\nAddictions are incredibly negative things in our lives. \\n\\nLike all addictions, in time it will destroy relationships, it will cost time, it will cost money, and it will make your life *worse*.\\n\\n---\\n\\nBut why stop here?\\n\\nScience has proved, and *continues* to prove, that those who spend more and more time on social media face higher rates of depression than people that spend less time on it.\\n\\nDo a simple web search \\\"facebook and depression\\\".

No one is naive about this.\n\nIf we intend on keeping social media as a part of our culture and our lives,\nit's time to re-think how we interact with the tools themselves and it is time\nto re-evaluate how we interact with others online.\n\nReaching someone through an online discussion through bantering and harsh\ncriticism does not help your cause, whatever that may be. Empathy and decency\ngoes a long way when proposing your opinion or idea.\n\nWith so much knowledge in the world, there is so little wisdom.\n\nWisdom is what people are really looking for.\n\nLet us be wise in our interactions online.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOne of my favorite discussions on this topic is by journalist\nJon Ronson. In his TED talk titled \"How One Tweet Can Ruin Your Life\"\n[https://youtu.be/wAIP6fI0NAI], he finishes with the following statement...\n\n> \"Twitter is basically a 'mutual approval' machine. We use it to surround\nourselves with people that think and feel the same way that we do. But we are\nnow creating a surveillance society where the smartest way to survive is to go\nback to being voiceless. Let's not do that.\" - Jon Ronson\n[http://www.jonronson.com]\n\n\nI agree with Jon.\n\nIn the beginning, social media platforms brought people together.\n\nI believe that, if used wisely, social media networks can still bring people\ntogether in a positive way.\n\nEmpathy and decency is not all lost.\n\nLet's not go silent and let's not allow the idealogs to own our voices.\n\n * Joey D","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1480694313141-fce5e697ee25?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ&s=16cee079798c8b1aa5098bcb994f7af3","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-02-20T04:16:53.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2019-01-20T22:01:27.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":null,"published_by":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc815","uuid":"f049b26d-f4ef-4993-a075-4d4d417932fb","title":"What Mass Murderers Think","slug":"what-mass-murderers-think","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"What goes on in the mind that leads a mass murderer to perform the acts they do?

Also this will be a long post so just skip it if you don't want to read. Finally, I probably won't be commenting or reading any of the comments so please don't expect a response from me here. I'm done with trolling Facebook - it's just too much work to follow-up on everything in social media.\\n\\n--- \\n\\nI don't watch too many movies anymore as I'm very aware now of what types of worldviews and philosophies are being promoted in them. Not sure why this is but I heavily analyze things in movies now. Maybe this is just me getting older...\\n\\nA little while ago I decided to watched the movie \\\"The Founder\\\". It is a biopic of Ray Kroc and the McDonald's brothers and sort of told the story about the rise of the McDonald's restaurant empire and how it came to be. It was really good! I think this is definitely one of Michael Keaton's best performances by far. It is really interesting to see a take on how things might have happened with regards to business dealings and actual events that happened behind the scenes in how the McDonald's Corp came to be.\\n\\nWithout spoiling anything about the plot of the movie, there were a few parts of it that sort of tap into Ray Kroc's marriage and divorce. The actors and actresses do an outstanding job of making you 'feel' the emotions of the scenes and what is going on in the story. This is why I think movies have an effect me more than they used to...\\n\\nOne of the things that I know about myself is that I care deeply about relationships. I also have the gift of discernment - I am able to quite easily place myself into other people's shoes, to feel what they are feeling so to speak. So when there are scenes in movies or TV that deal with divorce or cheating, I don't do well with it and have a very hard time getting past the 'feelings' of the scene. I get upset because it goes against the core of my being.\\n\\nNow, yes I do end up getting past the feeling of course :) I don't stay depressed or anything. But I do reflect on myself. I do think about what I am doing in my life. I think about my family and question myself about how I am maintaining my relationships with Tasha and the kids, and ask myself if I am doing anything wrong, or anything against what I have made promises to.\\n\\nI do recognize that divorce does happen for various reasons. Divorce does happen between some people. And yes, the reasons why divorce can happen may be justified or even sometimes necessary. But my worldview does not support divorce as a *good thing*. \\n\\nI will be very clear. I do not believe that divorce is good.\\n\\nWhy do I believe this?\\n\\nMy reasons as to why I believe that divorce is a bad thing is multi-dimensional as well as complicated. I've been through some very tough times, as have many of my own close family members and friends. I will do my best to attempt to answer why. \\n\\nOne reason is because I am a 'relationship guy'. I care deeply about relationships in general. This is the way my brain is wired and it affects how I interact with people in my life and how I operate in general. I believe in building positive relationships with as many people as I can, building my network of people, helping others succeed, connecting with others on a real level. I use keywords here for a reason - building, connecting, success, commitment, excellence, and the list goes on. Please don't misunderstand when I say this. I am NOT a perfect person at all. I do make mistakes just like everyone else. \\n\\nWe all know what divorce is. Divorce is the severing of relationships. Note that I say \\\"relationships\\\". It is plural. It separates people from each other by force or fiat. The purpose of divorce is to destroy the marriage relationship. It doesn't only sever the two people that are married. It also seperates friendships that may have been built up over the years. Friends typically have to choose a side. Children also have to go through this process of having to bifurcate their father and mother relationships and treat them differently or act differently towards each. Insecurities evolve. Divorce is a distructive act with lasting ripple effects across time.\\n\\nI will go even farther to say this --- All divorces occur due to selfishness. For those that have cheated on their spouses, it is because you made the decision that your own selfishness matters more. For those that verbally or physically abuse your spouses and/or children, you somehow convince yourself that it is OK to do such an act even though you know it was wrong - deception is real. Divorce is always caused by some type of selfishness from at least one person in the marriage relationship which is pathological in nature.\\n\\nDid you know that even with the high divorce rate and it's commonality in today's day and age that divorce is still regarded as a 'negative' thing? I'll say again that yes I do believe it is a very bad thing. With the destruction that divorce causes how can anyone possibly think it is a good thing?\\n\\nWith that being said, for those that are married or dating couples or those that want to marry, I think it is important that we really think about what we are doing in our relationships and really take in the gravity of the situation.\\n\\nHere are a few key things that I hope you think about. Read them all slowly. Read them out loud if you can:\\n- Marriage is a promise, it is a choice, it is a decision.\\n- Marriage is for life.\\n- Marriage is fun! (Yes, it really is!)\\n- Marriage is a gift!\\n\\n**Marriage is designed to make us more self-less and less selfish over time.**\\n\\nI hope you really think about this last one. Over time it becomes less about \\\"me\\\" and more about \\\"us\\\". Marriage, if done correctly, is designed to make us less selfish and more selfless. It is all about 'service', giving, gratefulness...\\n\\n.....\\n\\nI've come up with a list of words that, I think, help to describe what marriage is all about. Seriously think about these words and what they mean to you:\\n\\n- Commitment\\n- Integrity\\n- Dedication\\n- Dependable\\n- Credible\\n- Honor\\n- Trust\\n- Discipline\\n- Intimacy\\n- Sacredness\\n- Service\\n- Responsibility\\n- Accountability\\n- Promises\\n- Best\\n- Hope\\n- Love\\n- Beauty\\n- Thoughtfullness\\n\\nImagine that each word here is written down on a survey about marriage. And next to each word is a check box, then this survey is given to your spouse and they are asked to check every word they feel that you do have. And when they submitted this survey, they were HONEST.\\n\\n** How many check marks would you have? **\\n\\n...\\n\\nI think that for some of you this really hits home.\\n\\nIt does for me. I am not perfect whatsoever. Not even close.\\n\\nI start thinking about some of my own actions lately and some of the things that I've said that there is no way my wife would have placed a check mark for! I know this, and it makes me want to be a better man and not do it again. I care deeply for my wife and children and I don't want to make mistakes.\\n\\nAs a married man I would hope that my wife would check every box on that survey not because I simply want to pass the survey with flying colors, but because that is the person that my wife ACTUALLY views in me!\\n\\n...\\n\\nI have a message for most (not all) married people so I'm going to be very blunt here ---\\n\\n**** We have all been doing a really crappy job at being married. ****\\n\\nThis is not an argument, I'm making a statement.\\n\\nLook around.\\n\\nHow many people do you know that have experienced divorce firsthand? This could be anyone at your workplace, school, or community. It could be a family member, friend, or acquaintence. \\n\\nSeriously. Married people have not been doing a good job of being married.\\n\\nThis is a fact. The statistics don't lie:\\n\\n- In America, there is one divorce approximately every 36 seconds*. That's nearly 2,400 divorces per day, 16,800 divorces per week and 876,000 divorces a year.\\n- The average length of a marriage that ends in divorce is eight years.\\n- People wait an average of three years after a divorce to remarry (if they remarry at all).\\n- The average age for couples going through their first divorce is 30 years old.\\n- 46.9% percent of non-custodial mothers totally default on support (dads getting child support payments), while only 26.9% of non-custodial fathers totally default on support (moms getting child support payments).\\n- 43% of all children growing up in America in the 2010's are being raised without their fathers.\\n- 75% of children with divorced parents live with their mother.\\n- 28% of children living with a divorced parent live in a household with an income below the poverty line.\\n- Half of all American children will witness the breakup of a parent, or grandparent's marriage. Of these children close to half will also see the breakup of a parent or grandparent's second marriage.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nBy our own life experiences,\\n\\nWhen a child has the life experience of being a first-hand witness of their parent's divorce do you know what language is actually being said to them?\\n\\n\\\"This is normal.\\\"\\n\\nActions speak louder than words. \\n\\nIn fact, all actions are a spoken language. **All** actions.\\n\\nWhen a person shows up to work *on time*, every single day, it tells the leadership team that that employee *wants* to be there. \\nWhen a person shows up to work on time every day it tells the leadership team that the employee is fully committed to the job.\\nIt tells the leadership team that the employee is responsible.\\nIt may even tell the leadership team that the employee enjoys their work.\\n\\nWhen a friend give you a call and asks you for your help, and you show up to help them as asked at the time they were expecting you to arrive, it *tells* them that you truly care for them. It tells them that you want to be their friend, and for you to be their friend in kind.\\n\\nWhen I come home from a long day of work, and my children scream \\\"Daddy's home!\\\" then they run up to me and give me great big bear hugs, it tells me that my children trust me. It tells me that they are happy that I am home! It tells me that I just might be doing a good job being a good dad to them!\\n\\nYou don't need to speak in order to tell someone something. \\n\\nActions always speak louder than the spoken word.\\n\\nWhen two people stand in front of a crowd, profess their love to each other, and make a promise to commit to each other in all things, to promise to be there for each other in the good times and the bad times, to promise to be there for each other *no matter what* until the end of their lives, promise to be faithful to each other, it is telling everyone listening that \\\"I am taking responsibility for this relationship and I will not break this promise no matter what. This is mine and I will never let it go. I will do whatever it takes to keep that promise.\\\" This is what is actually being said when two people get married.\\n\\nBy our actions we are showing the world, and we are showing our children, what marriage is all about. \\n\\nWhen a couple divorces we are saying \\\"divorce is normal\\\". In fact we are teaching and telling the world that marriage doesn't even matter anymore. We are saying that marriage is an old idea that has no merit in this modern day and marriage doesn't matter.\\n\\nEveryone has heard the saying, \\\"promises are made to be broken\\\". Well with divorce we are saying that \\\"marriages are meant to be ended\\\". \\n\\nWhen we divorce, we are teaching our children that this is 'normal', that divorce is 'ok' and that divorce is standard human behavior.\\n\\n.....\\n\\n(This section may be hard for some people I know, sorry ahead of time...)\\n\\nSome of us have gone through the process of our parents divorcing. And some of us might be going through it right now.\\n\\nBut do you know what?\\n\\nDivorce really screws us up.\\n\\nIt screws up our kids.\\n\\nMy own parents divorced after about 23 years of marriage. I was 22 years old when it happened and I had just started dating my wife when it was announced that my parents were splitting up.\\n\\nWhen they started the divorce process, do you know what happened?\\n\\nInsecurity about all aspects of LIFE began to take hold in my mind. Questions like this came up all the time:\\n\\n- What is going to happen to me?\\n- What is going to happen to my parents?\\n- Is this what will happen with me when I get married?\\n- Is this what will happen to my siblings when they get married?\\n- Should I even bother getting married at all?\\n\\nYeah, this actually happened to me. There are some times when this same insecurity comes up in my mind and I have to really work it out. I know this happens to all children regardless of age in a divorce.\\n\\nHere is another thing that happened to me...\\nI don't normally talk about this but I will here since I'm on topic ---\\n\\nI don't ever talk to my father or my mother about marriage and I never ask them for any type of marriage advice.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nBecause trust and credibility are good friends. When you lose one you typically lose the other at the same time.\\n\\nWhen you lose someone's trust or credibility, it takes a very long time to gain it back. Now, this is only true and unique with my own parents. I'm not saying that I don't trust my parents at all, and I'm not trying to chastise them! Both are happily re-married and both probably have very good advice to give.\\n\\nI'm only trying to make a point. You wouldn't get medical advice from someone that had their medical license revoked and you wouldn't take financial advice from someone that went to prison for fraud. What I'm saying is that it is very difficult to ask my parents for marriage advice should I need it.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nDoes this bother you? I hope it does, because this stuff matters.\\n\\nThe point I'm trying to make is that while it still happens, and while it still may be a necessary step for certain situations, divorce in itself is not a good \\\"thing\\\".\\n\\nSo for those that are married, or want to get married, really think about how you are 'doing' marriage.\\n\\nDo everything you can to set up your own marriage for success.\\n\\nThink about these questions:\\n\\n- Do I appreciate my spouse?\\n- Do I show them my appreciation?\\n- What are some of the things that I can do for my spouse that make them feel loved by me? (Ask them this question, their answer might surprise you!)\\n- Am I lying to them about anything?\\n- What is at least one thing that I am grateful for in my spouse?\\n\\nThere are many more questions that apply here. But just remember that marriage is not about \\\"me\\\" or \\\"you\\\". It is about \\\"us\\\". And it is important that all married people adpot responsibility for our actions and correct our own ways.\\n\\nIt is important that we make the correct decisions in our personal and professional lives. This means that we actually do need to know what is 'right' and what is 'wrong'.\\n\\nWe do need a kick in the rear every once in a while, and steer ourselves back on the right track.\\n\\nTake your relationships seriously. Because believe it or not, they actually matter not only to you but to your peers and your children.\\n\\nMake every day in your marriage count.\\n\\nBe a better person today than you were yesterday.\\n\\nApply good, positive, principles in your lives.\\n\\nSet goals and seriously think about them every day.\\n\\nSet goals at work.\\n\\nSet goals in your marriage and talk about them with your spouse.\\n\\nSet up your life so that you and your spouse reach those goals together.\\n\\nAdpot the concepts of \\\"teamwork\\\" and \\\"alignment\\\" in your marriage.\\n\\nBelieve in your spouse. \\n\\nServe them, love them as you love yourself.\\n\\nTake responsibility for your actions and be highly aware of them.\\n\\nTeach your children.\\n\\nLove, honor, and build trust in your spouse and your children.\\n\\nKnow what it means to be grateful.\\n\\nBe grateful.\\n\\n- Joey D\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Some good hard truths about marriage, why it is good, what it means, and why it should be taken seriously.</p>\n<p>**Disclaimers: I might get into some trouble with this post but it is worth it I think.

Not sure why this is but I heavily analyze things in movies now. Maybe this is just me getting older...</p>\n<p>A little while ago I decided to watched the movie &quot;The Founder&quot;. It is a biopic of Ray Kroc and the McDonald's brothers and sort of told the story about the rise of the McDonald's restaurant empire and how it came to be. It was really good! I think this is definitely one of Michael Keaton's best performances by far. It is really interesting to see a take on how things might have happened with regards to business dealings and actual events that happened behind the scenes in how the McDonald's Corp came to be.</p>\n<p>Without spoiling anything about the plot of the movie, there were a few parts of it that sort of tap into Ray Kroc's marriage and divorce. The actors and actresses do an outstanding job of making you 'feel' the emotions of the scenes and what is going on in the story. This is why I think movies have an effect me more than they used to...</p>\n<p>One of the things that I know about myself is that I care deeply about relationships. I also have the gift of discernment - I am able to quite easily place myself into other people's shoes, to feel what they are feeling so to speak. So when there are scenes in movies or TV that deal with divorce or cheating, I don't do well with it and have a very hard time getting past the 'feelings' of the scene. I get upset because it goes against the core of my being.</p>\n<p>Now, yes I do end up getting past the feeling of course :) I don't stay depressed or anything. But I do reflect on myself. I do think about what I am doing in my life. I think about my family and question myself about how I am maintaining my relationships with Tasha and the kids, and ask myself if I am doing anything wrong, or anything against what I have made promises to.</p>\n<p>I do recognize that divorce does happen for various reasons. Divorce does happen between some people. And yes, the reasons why divorce can happen may be justified or even sometimes necessary. But my worldview does not support divorce as a <em>good thing</em>.</p>\n<p>I will be very clear. I do not believe that divorce is good.</p>\n<p>Why do I believe this?</p>\n<p>My reasons as to why I believe that divorce is a bad thing is multi-dimensional as well as complicated. I've been through some very tough times, as have many of my own close family members and friends. I will do my best to attempt to answer why.</p>\n<p>One reason is because I am a 'relationship guy'. I care deeply about relationships in general. This is the way my brain is wired and it affects how I interact with people in my life and how I operate in general. I believe in building positive relationships with as many people as I can, building my network of people, helping others succeed, connecting with others on a real level. I use keywords here for a reason - building, connecting, success, commitment, excellence, and the list goes on. Please don't misunderstand when I say this. I am NOT a perfect person at all. I do make mistakes just like everyone else.</p>\n<p>We all know what divorce is. Divorce is the severing of relationships. Note that I say &quot;relationships&quot;. It is plural. It separates people from each other by force or fiat. The purpose of divorce is to destroy the marriage relationship. It doesn't only sever the two people that are married. It also seperates friendships that may have been built up over the years. Friends typically have to choose a side. Children also have to go through this process of having to bifurcate their father and mother relationships and treat them differently or act differently towards each. Insecurities evolve. Divorce is a distructive act with lasting ripple effects across time.</p>\n<p>I will go even farther to say this --- All divorces occur due to selfishness. For those that have cheated on their spouses, it is because you made the decision that your own selfishness matters more. For those that verbally or physically abuse your spouses and/or children, you somehow convince yourself that it is OK to do such an act even though you know it was wrong - deception is real. Divorce is always caused by some type of selfishness from at least one person in the marriage relationship which is pathological in nature.</p>\n<p>Did you know that even with the high divorce rate and it's commonality in today's day and age that divorce is still regarded as a 'negative' thing? I'll say again that yes I do believe it is a very bad thing. With the destruction that divorce causes how can anyone possibly think it is a good thing?</p>\n<p>With that being said, for those that are married or dating couples or those that want to marry, I think it is important that we really think about what we are doing in our relationships and really take in the gravity of the situation.</p>\n<p>Here are a few key things that I hope you think about. Read them all slowly. Read them out loud if you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marriage is a promise, it is a choice, it is a decision.</li>\n<li>Marriage is for life.</li>\n<li>Marriage is fun! (Yes, it really is!)</li>\n<li>Marriage is a gift!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Marriage is designed to make us more self-less and less selfish over time.</strong></p>\n<p>I hope you really think about this last one. Over time it becomes less about &quot;me&quot; and more about &quot;us&quot;. Marriage, if done correctly, is designed to make us less selfish and more selfless. It is all about 'service', giving, gratefulness...</p>\n<p>.....</p>\n<p>I've come up with a list of words that, I think, help to describe what marriage is all about. Seriously think about these words and what they mean to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Commitment</li>\n<li>Integrity</li>\n<li>Dedication</li>\n<li>Dependable</li>\n<li>Credible</li>\n<li>Honor</li>\n<li>Trust</li>\n<li>Discipline</li>\n<li>Intimacy</li>\n<li>Sacredness</li>\n<li>Service</li>\n<li>Responsibility</li>\n<li>Accountability</li>\n<li>Promises</li>\n<li>Best</li>\n<li>Hope</li>\n<li>Love</li>\n<li>Beauty</li>\n<li>Thoughtfullness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Imagine that each word here is written down on a survey about marriage. And next to each word is a check box, then this survey is given to your spouse and they are asked to check every word they feel that you do have. And when they submitted this survey, they were HONEST.</p>\n<p>** How many check marks would you have? **</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>I think that for some of you this really hits home.</p>\n<p>It does for me. I am not perfect whatsoever. Not even close.</p>\n<p>I start thinking about some of my own actions lately and some of the things that I've said that there is no way my wife would have placed a check mark for! I know this, and it makes me want to be a better man and not do it again. I care deeply for my wife and children and I don't want to make mistakes.</p>\n<p>As a married man I would hope that my wife would check every box on that survey not because I simply want to pass the survey with flying colors, but because that is the person that my wife ACTUALLY views in me!</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>I have a message for most (not all) married people so I'm going to be very blunt here ---</p>\n<p>**** We have all been doing a really crappy job at being married. ****</p>\n<p>This is not an argument, I'm making a statement.</p>\n<p>Look around.</p>\n<p>How many people do you know that have experienced divorce firsthand?

Divorce is always caused by some type of selfishness from at least one\nperson in the marriage relationship which is pathological in nature.\n\nDid you know that even with the high divorce rate and it's commonality in\ntoday's day and age that divorce is still regarded as a 'negative' thing? I'll\nsay again that yes I do believe it is a very bad thing. With the destruction\nthat divorce causes how can anyone possibly think it is a good thing?\n\nWith that being said, for those that are married or dating couples or those that\nwant to marry, I think it is important that we really think about what we are\ndoing in our relationships and really take in the gravity of the situation.\n\nHere are a few key things that I hope you think about. Read them all slowly.\nRead them out loud if you can:\n\n * Marriage is a promise, it is a choice, it is a decision.\n * Marriage is for life.\n * Marriage is fun! (Yes, it really is!)\n * Marriage is a gift!\n\nMarriage is designed to make us more self-less and less selfish over time.\n\nI hope you really think about this last one. Over time it becomes less about\n\"me\" and more about \"us\". Marriage, if done correctly, is designed to make us\nless selfish and more selfless. It is all about 'service', giving,\ngratefulness...\n\n.....\n\nI've come up with a list of words that, I think, help to describe what marriage\nis all about. Seriously think about these words and what they mean to you:\n\n * Commitment\n * Integrity\n * Dedication\n * Dependable\n * Credible\n * Honor\n * Trust\n * Discipline\n * Intimacy\n * Sacredness\n * Service\n * Responsibility\n * Accountability\n * Promises\n * Best\n * Hope\n * Love\n * Beauty\n * Thoughtfullness\n\nImagine that each word here is written down on a survey about marriage. And next\nto each word is a check box, then this survey is given to your spouse and they\nare asked to check every word they feel that you do have. And when they\nsubmitted this survey, they were HONEST.\n\n** How many check marks would you have? **\n\n...\n\nI think that for some of you this really hits home.\n\nIt does for me. I am not perfect whatsoever. Not even close.\n\nI start thinking about some of my own actions lately and some of the things that\nI've said that there is no way my wife would have placed a check mark for! I\nknow this, and it makes me want to be a better man and not do it again. I care\ndeeply for my wife and children and I don't want to make mistakes.\n\nAs a married man I would hope that my wife would check every box on that survey\nnot because I simply want to pass the survey with flying colors, but because\nthat is the person that my wife ACTUALLY views in me!\n\n...\n\nI have a message for most (not all) married people so I'm going to be very blunt\nhere ---\n\n**** We have all been doing a really crappy job at being married. ****\n\nThis is not an argument, I'm making a statement.\n\nLook around.\n\nHow many people do you know that have experienced divorce firsthand? This could\nbe anyone at your workplace, school, or community. It could be a family member,\nfriend, or acquaintence.\n\nSeriously. Married people have not been doing a good job of being married.\n\nThis is a fact. The statistics don't lie:\n\n * In America, there is one divorce approximately every 36 seconds*. That's\n   nearly 2,400 divorces per day, 16,800 divorces per week and 876,000 divorces\n   a year.\n * The average length of a marriage that ends in divorce is eight years.\n * People wait an average of three years after a divorce to remarry (if they\n   remarry at all).\n * The average age for couples going through their first divorce is 30 years\n   old.\n * 46.9% percent of non-custodial mothers totally default on support (dads\n   getting child support payments), while only 26.9% of non-custodial fathers\n   totally default on support (moms getting child support payments).\n * 43% of all children growing up in America in the 2010's are being raised\n   without their fathers.\n * 75% of children with divorced parents live with their mother.\n * 28% of children living with a divorced parent live in a household with an\n   income below the poverty line.\n * Half of all American children will witness the breakup of a parent, or\n   grandparent's marriage. Of these children close to half will also see the\n   breakup of a parent or grandparent's second marriage.\n\n.....\n\nBy our own life experiences,\n\nWhen a child has the life experience of being a first-hand witness of their\nparent's divorce do you know what language is actually being said to them?\n\n\"This is normal.\"\n\nActions speak louder than words.\n\nIn fact, all actions are a spoken language. All  actions.\n\nWhen a person shows up to work on time, every single day, it tells the\nleadership team that that employee wants  to be there.\nWhen a person shows up to work on time every day it tells the leadership team\nthat the employee is fully committed to the job.\nIt tells the leadership team that the employee is responsible.\nIt may even tell the leadership team that the employee enjoys their work.\n\nWhen a friend give you a call and asks you for your help, and you show up to\nhelp them as asked at the time they were expecting you to arrive, it tells  them\nthat you truly care for them. It tells them that you want to be their friend,\nand for you to be their friend in kind.\n\nWhen I come home from a long day of work, and my children scream \"Daddy's home!\"\nthen they run up to me and give me great big bear hugs, it tells me that my\nchildren trust me. It tells me that they are happy that I am home! It tells me\nthat I just might be doing a good job being a good dad to them!\n\nYou don't need to speak in order to tell someone something.\n\nActions always speak louder than the spoken word.\n\nWhen two people stand in front of a crowd, profess their love to each other, and\nmake a promise to commit to each other in all things, to promise to be there for\neach other in the good times and the bad times, to promise to be there for each\nother no matter what  until the end of their lives, promise to be faithful to\neach other, it is telling everyone listening that \"I am taking responsibility\nfor this relationship and I will not break this promise no matter what. This is\nmine and I will never let it go. I will do whatever it takes to keep that\npromise.\" This is what is actually being said when two people get married.\n\nBy our actions we are showing the world, and we are showing our children, what\nmarriage is all about.\n\nWhen a couple divorces we are saying \"divorce is normal\". In fact we are\nteaching and telling the world that marriage doesn't even matter anymore. We are\nsaying that marriage is an old idea that has no merit in this modern day and\nmarriage doesn't matter.\n\nEveryone has heard the saying, \"promises are made to be broken\". Well with\ndivorce we are saying that \"marriages are meant to be ended\".\n\nWhen we divorce, we are teaching our children that this is 'normal', that\ndivorce is 'ok' and that divorce is standard human behavior.\n\n.....\n\n(This section may be hard for some people I know, sorry ahead of time...)\n\nSome of us have gone through the process of our parents divorcing. And some of\nus might be going through it right now.\n\nBut do you know what?\n\nDivorce really screws us up.\n\nIt screws up our kids.\n\nMy own parents divorced after about 23 years of marriage. I was 22 years old\nwhen it happened and I had just started dating my wife when it was announced\nthat my parents were splitting up.\n\nWhen they started the divorce process, do you know what happened?\n\nInsecurity about all aspects of LIFE began to take hold in my mind. Questions\nlike this came up all the time:\n\n * What is going to happen to me?\n * What is going to happen to my parents?\n * Is this what will happen with me when I get married?\n * Is this what will happen to my siblings when they get married?\n * Should I even bother getting married at all?\n\nYeah, this actually happened to me. There are some times when this same\ninsecurity comes up in my mind and I have to really work it out. I know this\nhappens to all children regardless of age in a divorce.\n\nHere is another thing that happened to me...\nI don't normally talk about this but I will here since I'm on topic ---\n\nI don't ever talk to my father or my mother about marriage and I never ask them\nfor any type of marriage advice.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause trust and credibility are good friends. When you lose one you typically\nlose the other at the same time.\n\nWhen you lose someone's trust or credibility, it takes a very long time to gain\nit back. Now, this is only true and unique with my own parents. I'm not saying\nthat I don't trust my parents at all, and I'm not trying to chastise them! Both\nare happily re-married and both probably have very good advice to give.\n\nI'm only trying to make a point. You wouldn't get medical advice from someone\nthat had their medical license revoked and you wouldn't take financial advice\nfrom someone that went to prison for fraud. What I'm saying is that it is very\ndifficult to ask my parents for marriage advice should I need it.\n\n.....\n\nDoes this bother you? I hope it does, because this stuff matters.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that while it still happens, and while it still\nmay be a necessary step for certain situations, divorce in itself is not a good\n\"thing\".\n\nSo for those that are married, or want to get married, really think about how\nyou are 'doing' marriage.\n\nDo everything you can to set up your own marriage for success.\n\nThink about these questions:\n\n * Do I appreciate my spouse?\n * Do I show them my appreciation?\n * What are some of the things that I can do for my spouse that make them feel\n   loved by me? (Ask them this question, their answer might surprise you!)\n * Am I lying to them about anything?\n * What is at least one thing that I am grateful for in my spouse?\n\nThere are many more questions that apply here. But just remember that marriage\nis not about \"me\" or \"you\". It is about \"us\". And it is important that all\nmarried people adpot responsibility for our actions and correct our own ways.\n\nIt is important that we make the correct decisions in our personal and\nprofessional lives. This means that we actually do need to know what is 'right'\nand what is 'wrong'.\n\nWe do need a kick in the rear every once in a while, and steer ourselves back on\nthe right track.\n\nTake your relationships seriously. Because believe it or not, they actually\nmatter not only to you but to your peers and your children.\n\nMake every day in your marriage count.\n\nBe a better person today than you were yesterday.\n\nApply good, positive, principles in your lives.\n\nSet goals and seriously think about them every day.\n\nSet goals at work.\n\nSet goals in your marriage and talk about them with your spouse.\n\nSet up your life so that you and your spouse reach those goals together.\n\nAdpot the concepts of \"teamwork\" and \"alignment\" in your marriage.\n\nBelieve in your spouse.\n\nServe them, love them as you love yourself.\n\nTake responsibility for your actions and be highly aware of them.\n\nTeach your children.\n\nLove, honor, and build trust in your spouse and your children.\n\nKnow what it means to be grateful.\n\nBe grateful.\n\n * Joey D","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493103621021-63991650ba27?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ&s=0105542fb8c19068643303d0ba6308e1","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-02-20T04:59:02.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2019-01-20T22:20:26.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":null,"published_by":null,"custom_excerpt":"Some good hard truths about marriage, why it is good, what it means, and why it should be taken seriously.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc81a","uuid":"bef1632f-8fbd-4dc2-835f-90b26547e32b","title":"Being Average","slug":"being-average","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":null,"comment_id":"5a8e3736db47902a9ea75c70","plaintext":null,"feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-02-22T03:21:26.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-02-22T03:21:26.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":null,"published_by":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca8073f0c04bb1452bdc81b","uuid":"85b3421f-68b8-46dd-9f77-c817eb3ab437","title":"The Disney Theme Park Facade","slug":"disney-theme-parks","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I fail to understand why people are legitimately excited for Star Wars Galaxy's Edge or even the new super hero lands (*see note) and attractions, at Disney's theme parks.\\n\\nI want to think about this for a bit, starting with theme park pricing.\\n\\nDisney has successfully priced out most families from their theme parks a very long time ago.

Then let's say they visit twice a year, the average income earned from this type of visitor still hangs around $3000 per year --- half the earnings of a vacation package group.

Usually the first thing that comes to mind when we think about strength is \\\"physical strength\\\". We all know what physical strength is. It is linked to physical power or tensile limits. \\n\\nThere is strength in the mind. Specifically mental strength and emotional strength. One with emotional strength can endure tough times when they occur and won't lose themselves easily. In many cases those with high mental and emotional strength are the ones that people turn to in hard times. \\n\\nThere is strength in numbers. When multiple people pool their resources together they can achieve many things that fewer groups cannot.\\nWhen all the people of a nation share a common belief, when they come together under a common mantra, and they work together to achieve a common goal it is nearly impossible for them to fail. We think of this as \\\"unity\\\".\\n\\nWe are attracted to strength. There is a sort of *beauty* that comes along with strength.\\n\\nThose that are strong are admired. They are held in high regard. As humans it is natural for us to look up to those that are strong. We tend to equate \\\"the strong\\\" as leaders. We look to \\\"the strong\\\" to protect us. We feel safe when we are surrounded by a strong person or strong group. We feel safe and protected when we are members of a strong nation.\\n\\nNations that are perceived or thought of as being strong are considered healthy. These nations tend to persevere in hard times.

Strength can be perverted or distorted.\\n\\nStrength can be broken... becoming weakness.\\n\\n...\\n\\nWeakness.\\n\\nJust saying the word \\\"weakness\\\" instantly puts us in a bad frame of mind.\\nThe word itself is not attractive at all.

There is physical weakness, mental or personality weakness, weakness of the body, or weakness of the spirit. There is weak politics, weak nations, creative weakness, the list can go on and on.\\n\\nWe equate weakness with failure and ugliness. Weakness is seen as a negative trait.\\n\\nAs humans we distance ourselves from weakness or try to avoid it. We repel against weakness. We try to avoid it.\\n\\nWhen we view something as 'weak', it is easy for us to fall into the trap of thinking that it is beneath us.\\n\\nWhen we view someone as being weak, we tend to think of that person as being less than human. \\\"I am stronger than that weakling over there! I am a better person!\\\" This is a typical, or even natural, response.\\n\\nWhen even a nation's own people start to believe that we are 'weak', how can we find ourselves to come together? \\n\\nWhen outside nations start viewing \\n\\nA nation's strength can be decimated. \\n\\nI've been thinking about this lately...\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Strength.</p>\n<p>When was the last time you actually thought about <em>strength</em>?</p>\n<p>The word itself is appealing!

This one is a doozy. \\n\\nI've been holding onto this one for a while, trying to properly articulate my views on this topic. Hopefully I have done my job correctly in this post. \\n\\nOk... let's get into this.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhat an objectively absurd question. When this question is asked I always wonder what the intentions are of the person asking. \\n\\nQuestions like this typically means the one asking has not done their homework, or has bought into an ideaology without truly thinking about this very complex problem for *themselves*, is intended to incite some type of accusation or riot, or all items listed above. \\n\\nBut let's go ahead and answer this question and get that out of the way...\\n\\n*Should men and women be paid equally?*\\n\\nIf you mean for the simple sake of *equality of outcome* then my answer is absolutely not.\\nIf you mean should men and women be paid equally for the same job, with the same quality of work, and the same job role, then my answer is \\\"I don't know\\\".\\n\\nMy bottom line is this...\\n\\n**Gender should not play a role in determining wages.**\\n\\nThis is my own personal belief and I think that is something that we can all agree on. However the way this question is posed assumes there is a serious gender-based bias regarding wages in the west. I know that there must still be some employers in the west that continue to discriminate against women or those that are gay by suppressing their earning wages. However I myself am a skeptic in the claim that in this day and age this is a widespread issue. But we can debate this another time.\\n\\nWhat we do know is that yes; it is true that women, *as a group*, do get paid less than *men as a group*. The claim that women \\\"make around 79 cents for every dollar earned by men\\\" is a widespread belief. But when making this statement we are leaving out all of the complicated factors about how wages are determined, as well as what people are willing to accept for their own wages. Plus, this claim does not represent all women in all areas. For example, almost all of my managers and directors in every place I've worked have mostly been women and all had significantly higher wages than myself. Are these edge cases? I think not. Also, when making this claim they are leaving out the fact that this specific gap has been rapidly closing over a very short period of time and continues to do so as more and more women join the workforce and more and more women take even higher paying jobs in both blue and white collar positions.\\n\\nThe fact of the matter is that determining individual wages a very complex issue with no quick or simple answer. Virtually all employees are paid differently for a variety of reasons. Some reasons of which are valid, and others which may not be valid. But nonetheless people are paid differently.\\n\\nLet us ask the question in a different manner...\\n\\n*Should two people, with the same title, the same job description, same boss, and same responsibilities be paid exactly the same?*\\n\\nSaying \\\"yes\\\" is the wrong answer. But so is saying \\\"no\\\" because as it turns out the true answer is not that simple. The answer is more complex than you think. The correct answer could be, \\\"It depends\\\" or even \\\"I don't know\\\".\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nThe answer is because of a wide array of factors that goes into how much salary a person earns. It is part of a multi-factored analysis that must be taken into account and cannot be left out. For example, many questions need to be answered such as:\\n\\n* How much experience does the person have?\\n* How long have they been in their current position?\\n* Do they show leadership potential?\\n* Have they consistently been doing the job correctly?\\n* Do they have the proper training and skills?\\n* Do they show up on time and leave at an appropriate time every work day, consistently?\\n* Does the person even display that they want to work there?\\n* Is this employee considered reliable and dependable?\\n* Are we paying the individual comprable market rates for their labor?\\n\\nThose are questions about an individual person. Next, you now have to focus on questions on the business and its leadership itself...\\n\\n* Is the leadership corrupt? Or do they actually display integrity? How do they do this?\\n* Are there checks and balances in their hiring and firing practices?\\n* Is the business consistently working to train and improve their personnel and business practices? \\n* Have they consistently shown that they care about their employees? How have they done this?\\n* And many more...\\n\\n*Note that these questions don't ask anything about a person's worldview, gender, or personal identity because those things do not, and should not, matter when determining wages.*\\n\\nSo let's assume that we have asked these questions and we have some answers to them. Now, how do you properly match and weigh these answers to help determine a person's salary? Not every business has the exact same policies and procedures regarding salary rules. Where do you even begin?\\n\\nI honestly have absolutely no idea. I suppose for myself, I rely on the market to help determine my own wages so I do assume this is how businesses pay wages as well.\\n\\nOn a similar note, I believe that wages is something that trade and labor unions have attempted to try to help with because of historical corruption from business leadership in the past. Most unions enforce blanket wages policy across the board, with some wages based on \\\"levels\\\" or years of service and so forth. I must confess, I am not well versed in the pros and cons of labor unions. However from an outsider's perspective it appears that *most* unions nowadays are simply corrupt themselves and have made the wages situation worse over time. However that is another topic for another day...\\n\\n---\\n\\nI am one of the kind of people that does not care how much money another person makes, even if that person has the same title or job role as me. I simply have the expectation that my superiors are paid more than myself.\\n\\nI simply just don't care about anybody else's salary other than my own because I really can control how much I want to earn in my life through hard work, education, and the market. I have found that it is wise to only focus on the things that I can control myself instead of focusing on everybody else's problems. If I really felt like I was being taken advantage of, that I was lowballed in my salary, then I would freely leave and find something else.\\n\\nIn today's western society we operate under the basic rules of a free market economic system called capitalism. It has been like this for a very long time. And a part of the rules of capitalism has to do with salary. Everyone that I work with at my current job does make a different salary than me. Some are paid more, some are paid less. Some are women and some are men. And the reason why people are paid differently is because of experience or title or years of service or other similar factors.\\n\\nIn free market systems like capitalism there are concepts like goods, services, and labor. When I go to work, that is me selling my labor. My labor has a cost. If the business is not willing to pay for my labor then I take it somewhere else. It is their loss. Sometimes my labor gets more expensive. And if the business values that labor they will pay for it. Concepts of value vary widely as well, such as the law of supply and demand. I could go on and on but you get the point.\\n\\nCapitalism in the west has thrived for centuries thanks to markets. The markets dictate who will succeed and who will not succeed. And markets thrive the best in capitalist societies. **Capitalism, when done correctly, does not have built-in gender-bias.**\\n\\nSo if a business is corrupt by purposely underpaying women, and if the markets disapprove of this (which our society does disapprove of including myself personally), then people will take their money elsewhere and will not support that specific market - in effect causing that business (or even that market itself) to fail and crumble.\\n\\n**Markets are somewhat equivalent to freedom.**\\n\\nTo those who think that markets are/were built by the white male patriarchy, or that women have no power in markets, consider this:\\n\\n* Women account for more than 85% of all consumer purchasing decisions in the world. It has been like this for decades. \\n* In short, WOMEN control, and have controlled, how almost all money is spent worldwide!\\n* More than 50% of all marketing department employees in almost ALL businesses are women.\\n* Women dominate market decisions as well as marketing decisions.\\n\\nHow did this come to be? Has it always been this way? Perhaps. But does this mean that men are actively trying to oppress themselves and remove themselves from making market decisions? I don't think so. And does this even matter? Who cares if women have all of the purchasing power! It doesn't matter. Because men still get what they want and women still get what they want. It is a non-issue.\\n\\nSo for those that want to destroy markets, you effectively remove 'choice'. All you have left is 'central planning' where very few are making all of the decisions for the majority. And by the way, *big government means central planning*. It is the same thing. The Soviet Union, Germany, Vietnam, Cuba, and many more all tried to implement central planning. And all tried within the 20th century. Read history and see what happened as a result. Believe me that is a road that we do not want to go down...\\n\\nIf for some reason a great deal of the society is unhappy with how we're using capitalism today, and there is a great want to replace capitalism with something else, then I am open to having an honest and candid conversation about it. But what I am not willing to do is to just blindly accept whatever the popular alternative of the day is. I am not willing to destroy what is currently in place without having some type of alternative ready to go. And I am not willing to accept an alternative without seriously talking about the pros and cons. I want to make an intellectual decision. I want to be as correct as possible. Because if there is one thing that humans including myself have proven time and time again, is that we are NOT perfect and are prone to making very large and very quick mistakes with dire consequences.\\n\\nI think that our current economic system supports our individualistic ideals and allows us the thrive in a positive way. I do believe that yes, we can always do better too. There are always areas to improve and we should talk about these things without treating others with different ideas as less than human.\\n\\n---\\n\\nGender should not play a role in determining wages at all. But don't focus on this question because it is the wrong one to ask. Instead, try to think about the complexity of how wages are determined for individual people.\\n\\nEither we value individual contribution and pay the wages of the individual properly, or we don't. And if we choose not to, then God help us all...\\n\\n- Joey D\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>&quot;Should men and women be paid equally?&quot; Whoo boy...

But when making this statement we are\nleaving out all of the complicated factors about how wages are determined, as\nwell as what people are willing to accept for their own wages. Plus, this claim\ndoes not represent all women in all areas. For example, almost all of my\nmanagers and directors in every place I've worked have mostly been women and all\nhad significantly higher wages than myself. Are these edge cases? I think not.\nAlso, when making this claim they are leaving out the fact that this specific\ngap has been rapidly closing over a very short period of time and continues to\ndo so as more and more women join the workforce and more and more women take\neven higher paying jobs in both blue and white collar positions.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that determining individual wages a very complex issue\nwith no quick or simple answer. Virtually all employees are paid differently for\na variety of reasons. Some reasons of which are valid, and others which may not\nbe valid. But nonetheless people are paid differently.\n\nLet us ask the question in a different manner...\n\nShould two people, with the same title, the same job description, same boss, and\nsame responsibilities be paid exactly the same?\n\nSaying \"yes\" is the wrong answer. But so is saying \"no\" because as it turns out\nthe true answer is not that simple. The answer is more complex than you think.\nThe correct answer could be, \"It depends\" or even \"I don't know\".\n\nWhy?\n\nThe answer is because of a wide array of factors that goes into how much salary\na person earns. It is part of a multi-factored analysis that must be taken into\naccount and cannot be left out. For example, many questions need to be answered\nsuch as:\n\n * How much experience does the person have?\n * How long have they been in their current position?\n * Do they show leadership potential?\n * Have they consistently been doing the job correctly?\n * Do they have the proper training and skills?\n * Do they show up on time and leave at an appropriate time every work day,\n   consistently?\n * Does the person even display that they want to work there?\n * Is this employee considered reliable and dependable?\n * Are we paying the individual comprable market rates for their labor?\n\nThose are questions about an individual person. Next, you now have to focus on\nquestions on the business and its leadership itself...\n\n * Is the leadership corrupt? Or do they actually display integrity? How do they\n   do this?\n * Are there checks and balances in their hiring and firing practices?\n * Is the business consistently working to train and improve their personnel and\n   business practices?\n * Have they consistently shown that they care about their employees? How have\n   they done this?\n * And many more...\n\nNote that these questions don't ask anything about a person's worldview, gender,\nor personal identity because those things do not, and should not, matter when\ndetermining wages.\n\nSo let's assume that we have asked these questions and we have some answers to\nthem. Now, how do you properly match and weigh these answers to help determine a\nperson's salary? Not every business has the exact same policies and procedures\nregarding salary rules. Where do you even begin?\n\nI honestly have absolutely no idea. I suppose for myself, I rely on the market\nto help determine my own wages so I do assume this is how businesses pay wages\nas well.\n\nOn a similar note, I believe that wages is something that trade and labor unions\nhave attempted to try to help with because of historical corruption from\nbusiness leadership in the past. Most unions enforce blanket wages policy across\nthe board, with some wages based on \"levels\" or years of service and so forth. I\nmust confess, I am not well versed in the pros and cons of labor unions. However\nfrom an outsider's perspective it appears that most  unions nowadays are simply\ncorrupt themselves and have made the wages situation worse over time. However\nthat is another topic for another day...\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI am one of the kind of people that does not care how much money another person\nmakes, even if that person has the same title or job role as me. I simply have\nthe expectation that my superiors are paid more than myself.\n\nI simply just don't care about anybody else's salary other than my own because I\nreally can control how much I want to earn in my life through hard work,\neducation, and the market. I have found that it is wise to only focus on the\nthings that I can control myself instead of focusing on everybody else's\nproblems. If I really felt like I was being taken advantage of, that I was\nlowballed in my salary, then I would freely leave and find something else.\n\nIn today's western society we operate under the basic rules of a free market\neconomic system called capitalism. It has been like this for a very long time.\nAnd a part of the rules of capitalism has to do with salary. Everyone that I\nwork with at my current job does make a different salary than me. Some are paid\nmore, some are paid less. Some are women and some are men. And the reason why\npeople are paid differently is because of experience or title or years of\nservice or other similar factors.\n\nIn free market systems like capitalism there are concepts like goods, services,\nand labor. When I go to work, that is me selling my labor. My labor has a cost.\nIf the business is not willing to pay for my labor then I take it somewhere\nelse. It is their loss. Sometimes my labor gets more expensive. And if the\nbusiness values that labor they will pay for it. Concepts of value vary widely\nas well, such as the law of supply and demand. I could go on and on but you get\nthe point.\n\nCapitalism in the west has thrived for centuries thanks to markets. The markets\ndictate who will succeed and who will not succeed. And markets thrive the best\nin capitalist societies. Capitalism, when done correctly, does not have built-in\ngender-bias.\n\nSo if a business is corrupt by purposely underpaying women, and if the markets\ndisapprove of this (which our society does disapprove of including myself\npersonally), then people will take their money elsewhere and will not support\nthat specific market - in effect causing that business (or even that market\nitself) to fail and crumble.\n\nMarkets are somewhat equivalent to freedom.\n\nTo those who think that markets are/were built by the white male patriarchy, or\nthat women have no power in markets, consider this:\n\n * Women account for more than 85% of all consumer purchasing decisions in the\n   world. It has been like this for decades.\n * In short, WOMEN control, and have controlled, how almost all money is spent\n   worldwide!\n * More than 50% of all marketing department employees in almost ALL businesses\n   are women.\n * Women dominate market decisions as well as marketing decisions.\n\nHow did this come to be? Has it always been this way? Perhaps. But does this\nmean that men are actively trying to oppress themselves and remove themselves\nfrom making market decisions? I don't think so. And does this even matter? Who\ncares if women have all of the purchasing power! It doesn't matter. Because men\nstill get what they want and women still get what they want. It is a non-issue.\n\nSo for those that want to destroy markets, you effectively remove 'choice'. All\nyou have left is 'central planning' where very few are making all of the\ndecisions for the majority. And by the way, big government means central\nplanning. It is the same thing. The Soviet Union, Germany, Vietnam, Cuba, and\nmany more all tried to implement central planning. And all tried within the 20th\ncentury. Read history and see what happened as a result. Believe me that is a\nroad that we do not want to go down...\n\nIf for some reason a great deal of the society is unhappy with how we're using\ncapitalism today, and there is a great want to replace capitalism with something\nelse, then I am open to having an honest and candid conversation about it. But\nwhat I am not willing to do is to just blindly accept whatever the popular\nalternative of the day is. I am not willing to destroy what is currently in\nplace without having some type of alternative ready to go. And I am not willing\nto accept an alternative without seriously talking about the pros and cons. I\nwant to make an intellectual decision. I want to be as correct as possible.\nBecause if there is one thing that humans including myself have proven time and\ntime again, is that we are NOT perfect and are prone to making very large and\nvery quick mistakes with dire consequences.\n\nI think that our current economic system supports our individualistic ideals and\nallows us the thrive in a positive way. I do believe that yes, we can always do\nbetter too. There are always areas to improve and we should talk about these\nthings without treating others with different ideas as less than human.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGender should not play a role in determining wages at all. But don't focus on\nthis question because it is the wrong one to ask. Instead, try to think about\nthe complexity of how wages are determined for individual people.\n\nEither we value individual contribution and pay the wages of the individual\nproperly, or we don't. And if we choose not to, then God help us all...\n\n * Joey D","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/04/02-04_wages.jpeg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-04-30T01:30:05.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-10-01T02:24:38.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2018-10-01T02:24:38.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"Should men and women be paid equally?

I'm not going to get into the nitty gritty of every single line in the config file or the \\\"why\\\". The purpose of this post is to at least lead you in the right direction with getting a 'more secure' SNMP configuration set up in your environment on your CentOS/RHEL servers. There is always a better security configuration out there. \\n\\nI’ll post a follow up on how to get this done in CentOS/RHEL v7 at a later time. This article assumes that you are somewhat familiar with how to execute shell commands and work with the vim text editor. I also assume that the following is set up: \\n\\n* SELinux is enabled, hence the firewall is enabled too and is probably not allowing SNMP traffic in/out of the server.\\n* You have SUDO and/or ROOT access to the server.\\n* Net-SNMP is not installed yet.\\n\\nConfiguring and setting up SNMP is very straightforward. I will describe the process by the following steps: \\n\\n1. Install Net-SNMP using the yum package manager.\\n2. Create an SNMP configuration file.\\n3. Create your SNMPv3 user.\\n4. Allow SNMP traffic through the firewall.\\n5. Ensure the SNMP daemon starts at boot time.\\n6. Profit.\\n\\nSo let’s get started! \\n\\n## Install net-snmp\\n\\nIf SNMP is not yet installed on your server, execute the following shell command: \\n\\nsudo yum -y install net-snmp net-snmp-utils\\n\\n## Create an SNMP configuration file\\n\\nWhen net-snmp is installed on the machine, a sample/default file is created. So lets move that file to a new location because we are not going to use it. Execute, \\n\\nsudo mv /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf.orig\\n\\nNext, lets create a new file from scratch: \\n\\nsudo vim /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf\\n\\nHit 'i' to enter insert mode, then enter in the following text: \\n\\n# Basic SNMP Community Information# Note Source IPs. Enter in your own IPs that will be allowed to communicate with the service.# It is recommended to allow localhost so you can run tests with snmpwalk.# Otherwise omit localhost if it is not needed.# You can list allowed subnets if you wish. Example below.## Community.Name Source.IP.Allowedrocommunity public 127.0.0.1rocommunity public 10.40.60.57rocommunity public 192.168.1.0/24# Optional location informationsyslocation MyLocation# Optional contact informationsyscontact Super User <myemail@domain.com># SNMP v3 User Information\\n\\n** Note that the last line is commented out by the '#' and there is nothing in the SNMP v3 User Information section yet.

It has been quite a bit of time since I last wrote a post here. In my defense I have been insanely busy with family, work, and especially with planning my next SolarWinds NPM book. So on that note, let’s get straight to today’s topic – install GNS3 v1.4 on Windows 10. \\n\\n### What is GNS3?\\n\\nGNS stands for “graphical network simulator 3”. It is emulation software that can run real-time Cisco IOS, JunOS, and other network OSes in a virtual environment (think virtual machines for network OSes such as Cisco’s IOS routers). GNS3 is very popular for those that create proof-of-concept networks for their own enterprise environments but it is also very popular for those training for the coveted Cisco certifications. It is important because GNS3 can be used in place of real hardware. As of the time of this writing the current GNS3 release is v1.4.0. \\n\\nI am personally using GNS3 to help me with my next SolarWinds book. Plus it is just fun learning how to set up networks in a virtual environment. So lets get started! \\n_This guide assumes you have at least an intermediate knowledge of networking and server administration._\\n\\n### Requirements:\\n\\n1. A Windows 10 Pro PC with at least 8GB RAM and Quad-core CPU. \\n\\n** At the time of writing this post I’m using Windows 10 Pro build 10586.63 with 16GB RAM. (These instructions have not been tested on Windows 10 Home editions but it should work.)\\n2. [VMware Workstation 12 Pro](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation)\\n\\nAssuming you have VMware Workstation 12 Pro installed on your Windows 10 Pro PC, we can get started! Lets download the software we need: \\n\\n* GNS3 v1.4.0\\n* GNS3 Virtual Machine OVA Image for VMware\\n* Cisco 3660 IOS image\\n\\n### Download the GNS3 software\\n\\nNavigate to and log in (sign up for an account if you don’t have one). On the downloads page, note the links in the screenshot below. You need the Windows download as well as the GNS3 VM. Get both of them and save the files locally. \\n\\n### Get a supported Cisco IOS image\\n\\nCisco IOS images are downloaded from Cisco.com provided you are legally licensed for the software. Luckily I am legally licensed. For this example I am using the image c3660-jk9o3s-mz.124-25d.bin. \\n\\n### Import the GNS3 VM OVA into VMware Workstation\\n\\nBefore we GNS3 we need to import the VM image into VMware Workstation so it is ready to go. \\n\\n1. Launch VMware Workstation.\\n2. Click File > Open[![image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0Fk7-S5Q_yA/Vp8ZKJrt73I/AAAAAAAAIX4/XOn7PjrEsx0/image_thumb%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5kIYuU-OHZY/Vp8ZJghzdCI/AAAAAAAAIXw/Xadokm6GaQI/s1600-h/image%25255B7%25255D.png)\\n3. Locate and select the GNS3 VM.OVA file, click Open.\\n4. The Import Virtual Machine window will appear. Select the storage path and name for the VM (I’m using the default options). Click **Import** to finish.[![image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-O-6P2MV7iYc/Vp8ZKkvGpHI/AAAAAAAAIYI/s1cXxcxXvPM/image_thumb%25255B5%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-cL8tyrVQ9Co/Vp8ZKX7AjPI/AAAAAAAAIYA/jlYGlflilGc/s1600-h/image%25255B16%25255D.png)\\n\\nThe VM should now be imported and available. Leave VMW12 running (don’t close it) because GNS3 will automatically access the VM on-demand. We can now proceed with installing and configuring GNS3 on our PC. \\n\\n### Installing GNS3\\n\\nNow that we have all of the prerequisite items, we can move forward with the installation. \\n\\n1. Launch the installer, click **Next**.\\n2. Agree to the license terms, click **I Agree**.\\n3. At Choose Start Menu Folder, click **Next**.\\n4. At Choose Components, _select ALL items_ and click **Next**.\\n5. At Choose Install Location, define a location and click **Install**. **Default C:\\\\Program Files\\\\ is recommended.\\n6. The WinPcap installer will appear. Click **Next**\\n7. Click **I Agree** on the license terms.\\n8. Make sure the check mark is selected to automatically start the driver at boot time. Click **Install**, then **Finish**\\n9. The Wireshark installer will appear. Click **Next**, then click **I Agree**.\\n10. Select all components then click **Next**.\\n11. On Additional Tasks, click **Next**.\\n12. On Choose Install Location, leave the default location and click **Next**.\\n13. **Remove the checkmark** to install WinPcap (because we already installed it). Click **Install**.\\n14. When Wireshark is installed, click **Next** then **Finish**.\\n15. The SolarWinds Response Time Viewer installer will appear. Enter your email address then click **Continue**.\\n16. Click **Next**,\\n17. Accept the license terms, Click **Next**,\\n18. At Choose Install Location, leave the default path then click **Next**, then **Next** again.\\n19. Click **Finish**.\\n20. The GNS3 software will finish installing on it’s own. Click **Next** when done.\\n21. The “SolarWinds Standard Toolset” free license option appeared for me. I opted out of the free offer. I leave it up to you if you want it.\\n22. Go ahead and click Finish to launch GNS3 for the first time.\\n\\nLets move forward with initial setup. \\n\\n### Configuring GNS3\\n\\n1. The Setup Wizard will appear. Since we are using the GNS3 VM in VMware, choose the Local GNS3 VM option then click Next.[![image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XzKi8S8aLJM/Vp8ZLZDY_3I/AAAAAAAAIYY/Ew4_zdv0lM8/image_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4BmyBF4BnnM/Vp8ZLCUpAhI/AAAAAAAAIYQ/c11qP0u8VOs/s1600-h/image%25255B4%25255D.png)\\n2. Select VMware and the VM we imported. I recommend changing the vCPU cores to 2x and reducing the RAM to 2048 for now. Click **Next** to proceed. \\n\\nNOTE: You can always increase the vCPU cores to 4x and increase the RAM at a later time if you plan on having a larger virtual environment. My personal configuration is shown in the screenshot below.[![image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-X5qmpSYddLE/Vp8ZMgHGAnI/AAAAAAAAIYo/coPvyrJadvY/image_thumb%25255B7%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--eqCMNgHtQ4/Vp8ZL2I0gkI/AAAAAAAAIYk/l_kGhyq8wBE/s1600-h/image%25255B20%25255D.png)\\n3. GNS3 will automatically start up the virtual machine in VMware. At Add Virtual Machines, check the box “Add an IOS router using a real IOS image” then click **Finish**.[![image](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-riFo0ER_Zao/Vp8ZNdJKpTI/AAAAAAAAIY4/Sq2UgWB16Hs/image_thumb%25255B9%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-iM-Ed9khBKc/Vp8ZM8eV1EI/AAAAAAAAIYw/PuYfY_6VmQg/s1600-h/image%25255B24%25255D.png)\\n4.

GNS3 is now installed and working in VMware Workstation. If you\nopen up VMware you should see the GNS3 virtual machine running and should look\nsimilar to the screenshot below.\n\nAdding Your First Device to the Lab\nEverything is now good to go. So lets go ahead and add in the first device and\nget it up and running!\nClick the devices button, drag and drop the device into the lab pane, then click\nthe Play button.\n[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9xe72aAdBaY/Vp8ZT5JSk6I/AAAAAAAAIaw/kRs5iegKQQw/s1600-h/image%25255B61%25255D.png]\nIf everything is good, you’ll see the device status in green on the topology\npane. Right-click the device and choose Console to open up the PuTTY console\nwindow to confirm.\n\nFrom this point you should head over to the GNS3 community and start learning!\nHere is a direct link: .\n\nThere are also a bunch of additional how-to/example videos on YouTube for GNS3\nso you’ll want to look there as well.\n\nA few notes:\n\n * Don’t close VMware Workstation when you have GNS3 open because it will shut\n   down your virtual machines and cause GNS3 to crash.\n * Don’t close GNS3 until you have saved your lab because GNS3 will\n   automatically shut down the GNS3 VM in VMware Workstation when the app is\n   closed. Also when you launch GNS3 it will automatically launch VMware\n   Workstation and start up the VM. This is by design and is helpful so you\n   won’t have to remember to start/stop the VM when launching or closing GNS3.\n\nWell, that’s all I have for now. I’m still working on setting up my GNS3 and\nSolarWinds lab environments so maybe I’ll have more to write about soon. Have\nfun setting up your own labs!\n\nhttps://gns3.com/community","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1451187580459-43490279c0fa?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=1080&fit=max&s=90369b1af3c31e8d54930b1eab8adc35","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2016-01-20T10:20:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2017-10-20T02:46:06.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2016-01-20T10:20:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdcc34","uuid":"80a35716-2539-4b2f-8fbf-02131f3d3cd8","title":"How to Set the Execution Policy in Powershell 5.0","slug":"how_to_set_the_execution_policy_in_powershell_5_0-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I ran into a problem in Windows 10 (build 10130) where I couldn't set the Powershell execution policy to \\\"unrestricted\\\".

Believe it or not I knew nothing about the \\\"CryptoLocker\\\" ransomware because I've been working on backend support instead of desktop support over the past year. Also, I didn't know about some of the new accessibility features for the visual or hearing impaired in mobile devices (which is very very cool stuff!). I am very excited for our next SpiceCorp meetup because I know I will learn something new yet again. \\nIn my opinion, attending these IT Pro meetups have been one of the best things I've done for my career. I'm people networking with other IT Pros, I'm learning new things that I probably wouldn't have learned on my own, and it's just a fun time sharing war stories and ideas and projects. I think that attending meetups is the key to increasing and sharing knowledge. Attending IT Pro or Developer meetups can be extremely rewarding so I highly encourage that you find a group for yourself. \\n\\nIf you want to start up or attend a meetup group, here are some of my own tips: \\n\\n* Be consistent. – As an organizer this is something I learned the hard way. Having a regular meetup is a commitment. As an organizer, if you want people to come or if you want to maintain the group's existence and attendance it is important to be consistent. If you have a meetup every month make sure you schedule it and keep the date every month. If you meet at a regular place, don't suddenly change the venue without discussing the change with the group first. As an attendee, once you find a meetup group you like plan on attending as often as you can because it not only helps the group's comfort level increase with regards to discussion, but it also helps you get more comfortable in discussing topics. There is tremendous value here…\\n* Communicate Changes as Early as Possible – As an organizer make sure you give plenty of notice for when changes occur (such as venue locations or the meetup schedule). Everyone has time commitments so giving ample notice allows group members to plan on if they can attend or not. This is courtesy and is common sense. The same situation applies for attendees such as if you RSVP'ed but need to back out. Make sure you give notice of changes if you can't attend as a courtesy to the organizer(s).\\n* Plan on Joining the Conversation – Organizers should promote an open minded discussion on whatever technology topic your group members want to discuss. For example, in my last meetup I wasn't planning on talking about accessibility features but it led to a very vibrant and positive conversation. Even talking about mobile might not sound interesting but you'd be surprised what you might not have known about a topic you thought you were an expert in.\\n* Treat your meetup as a social learning event – IT Pro meetups exist not to hoard knowledge. They exist to share knowledge! If you host a meetup or attend one, plan on sharing something.\\n* Give away free swag every once in a while (if you can). – Being an IT Pro usually gets us access to cool stuff from vendors. Polo shirts or t-shirts, gift cards, coffee mugs, pens, mouse pads, free software licenses, and more are all at our fingertips. Giving away free stuff is usually an incentive for people to come. But the point of the meetup is not to try and draw in a bunch of people just to get attendance increased. Free swag should only be a bonus of attending the meetup and shouldn't be the reason why the meetup exists. Only give away swag every once in a while if you can help it.\\n\\nWell, there are many more but these are just a few of my own tips for meeting organizers and attendees. I hope you have\\\\find your own IT Pro meetup.

If you meet at a regular place, don't suddenly change the venue without discussing the change with the group first. As an attendee, once you find a meetup group you like plan on attending as often as you can because it not only helps the group's comfort level increase with regards to discussion, but it also helps you get more comfortable in discussing topics. There is tremendous value here…</li>\n<li>Communicate Changes as Early as Possible – As an organizer make sure you give plenty of notice for when changes occur (such as venue locations or the meetup schedule). Everyone has time commitments so giving ample notice allows group members to plan on if they can attend or not. This is courtesy and is common sense. The same situation applies for attendees such as if you RSVP'ed but need to back out. Make sure you give notice of changes if you can't attend as a courtesy to the organizer(s).</li>\n<li>Plan on Joining the Conversation – Organizers should promote an open minded discussion on whatever technology topic your group members want to discuss.

Believe it or not I knew nothing about the \"CryptoLocker\"\nransomware because I've been working on backend support instead of desktop\nsupport over the past year. Also, I didn't know about some of the new\naccessibility features for the visual or hearing impaired in mobile devices\n(which is very very cool stuff!). I am very excited for our next SpiceCorp\nmeetup because I know I will learn something new yet again.\nIn my opinion, attending these IT Pro meetups have been one of the best things\nI've done for my career. I'm people networking with other IT Pros, I'm learning\nnew things that I probably wouldn't have learned on my own, and it's just a fun\ntime sharing war stories and ideas and projects.

And rumor has it that Google will be releasing Android L in a few short months. So as you can see there has been quite a bit of talk about mobile. And with all of this talk, I’ve had mobile phone fever. It was time for me to select my next daily driver.\\n\\n## Why upgrade?\\n\\nFor the past year my daily driver has been the iPhone 4s.\\n\\n![](https://www.apple.com/lae/iphone-4s/specs/images/product_controls.jpg)\\n\\nThe reason why I’ve been using it is because my job provided me with it for work purposes. Over the past 14 months it more or less has gotten the job done. I’ve been able to respond to work emails, use the tethering here and there, and use Facetime when needed. However my 4s has been performing poorly much more often than normal. So naturally I’ve been wanting to upgrade to something else. For the curious, here is a list of the problems that I’ve been having with my 4s:\\n\\n* The external speaker has been cutting out at random times. When the phone rings, I only catch the calls half the time because the speaker never rings the call. I can’t narrow this down when or how the problem occurs, but it started after I upgraded the phone to iOS 7\\\\. I never had this problem when it was running iOS 6\\\\. I’ve read this is a common problem with the 4s…\\n* Phone performance has degraded quite a bit over the past year. There are various performance issues with my 4s where apps sometimes fail to open and I need to force close the app and try again. For example, the “Phone app” displays a grey screen instead of displaying the dialer sometimes. Yes, I do subscribe to podcasts and stream music daily. So I believe most of my performance problems is likely has to do with flash memory performance over time. The only solution for this is to get a newer device. For those that don’t know about why flash memory performance breaks down over time, I suggest you read this article.\\n* The small screen size doesn’t help. Sure I’ve been dealing with the 3.5 inch screen since last year and I’ve put up with it. But reading articles or reading emails on that tiny screen is really annoying. It is time to get something bigger.\\n* Battery life has severely degraded over the past year as well. When I first got the phone, a full charge in the morning allows me to use the 4s throughout the entire work day. This includes listening to a full hour of music or podcasts in the morning, making and taking iMessages and up to 5 phone calls (at 10 minutes per call) during the day, another hour of podcasting on my way home, and light usage until 8pm at night. I used to still have 30% battery life left at the end of the day. Nowadays my 4s would be dead before I leave the office to drive home --- and no, I don’t have Facebook installed on it and I don’t use GPS often.\\n\\nSo I’ve pretty much had enough with the iPhone 4s. It is time for me to upgrade! But to what device, and why?\\n\\n## My Requirements\\n\\nI came up with several requirements and my friends helped me write them down:\\n\\n1. Large bright screen\\n2. Video chat support for Facetime or Skype\\n3. Long battery life\\n4. Cisco AnyConnect in App Store\\n5. Great camera with flash\\n6. Chromecast support\\n\\nRight off the bat, I was a bit disappointed. Because of my requirements above I couldn’t choose a Windows Phone. I’ve heard of many people that love their Windows Phones, and I’ve heard of many people that hate them too. But I want to try a Windows Phone anyways and see how it goes for me. But without Chromecast supported apps or Cisco AnyConnect VPN I just can’t choose a Windows Phone – not right now. I’m a Verizon customer, so is most of my family and a large number of my colleagues. So I knew I was going to stick with Verizon again when I upgraded.\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\nI walked into the Verizon store and looked at all of the devices available. First was the Samsung wall. I looked at the Galaxy Note 3 first.\\n\\n![](http://www.3g.co.uk/g_phones/large/samsung-galaxy-note-3-review-2.jpg)\\n\\nIt was in it’s folio case so I got to check out the entire feature set. The screen was nice and bright and it was very responsive. The phone is huge! But after playing around with it for a few minutes, for me it was just too big. Now I am a big guy myself – I’m 6’5 and 300 pounds, and I have huge hands too (I can easily palm an NBA regulation sized basketball). But the device just didn’t feel right in one hand. The more I evaluated the Note 3 I came to the conclusion that I would be forced to use it most of the time with 2 hands. I did like the Note 3 but I kept eyeing the phone next to it – the Galaxy S4\\\\.\\n\\n![](http://cdn.thedroidguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S4.jpg?617318)\\n\\nSo I picked up the S4 and played around with it too. The S4 does have a very nice screen. But the device just didn’t feel right in my hands for some reason. The build quality was a bit questionable for my tastes, too ‘plasticy’. My wife has an S4 and she loves it but I’m picky. A Galaxy S5 was right next to the S4 so I checked that out too.\\n\\n![](http://www.t-mobile.com/content/dam/tmo/en-g/hotspot/rockford_hotspotflat_1240x700_mainimage.png)\\n\\nI liked the screen and the look and feel of the S5 much more than the S4\\\\. The S5 was light in the hand, was very responsive, and felt more durable than the S4\\\\. Also the back cover of the phone was less prone to slipping out of the hand than the S4\\\\. A colleague of mine has the Galaxy S5 Active on AT&T and he swears by it. He showed me a 1080p recording on it too, which was fantastic! I kept on playing around with the S5 and opened apps, called my phone to check the call quality, and took a few pics on the device just to see what it was like. My only gripe was that the Samsung devices still use TouchWiz UI which I do not like, but I could deal with it if needed. At this point the S5 was at the top of my list but I needed to check out the rest of the phones. I wanted to make sure I was making the right choice for me.\\n\\nRight next to the Galaxy devices was the HTC One M8 Windows edition.\\n\\n![](http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/htc-one-m8.jpg)\\n\\nMan, that is a really really nice phone! It is metal, has two speakers on the front, and the screen was awesome. Then next to that was the Nokia Lumia Icon Windows phone.\\n\\n![](http://cmsresources.windowsphone.com/windowsphone/en-US/cmpn/Nokia-Lumia-Icon/carousel/hero-state5.png)\\n\\nI must say that trying to pick out either the HTC or the Lumia was like Sophie’s choice. It is really hard to pick the one over the other. But if I had to pick one, I’d choose the Lumia Icon. I just liked the Lumia Icon more than the HTC. But I was forced to pass them up because of my requirements. Sorry, maybe in a few months there will be Cisco AnyConnect support in Windows Phone…\\n\\nNext up was the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.\\n\\n![](http://images.bwbx.io/cms/2014-09-10/0910_iphone_swap_970-630x420.jpg)\\n\\nI picked up the iPhone 6 first just to feel it in the hands and it did look and felt great. It was light, much lighter than my 4s to my surprise. It was responsive when swiping the screens, launching apps, and it took great pictures. The screen resolution and brightness was also fantastic. The whole device feels really good. I was also happy to see the iPhone 6 screen size. It seems like Apple finally got the right screen size for their phones in the iPhone 6\\\\. Right next to it was the iPhone 6 Plus. Just like the iPhone 6 it also felt great in the hand, but I put it down after 30 seconds. I just knew that I wasn’t going to select that phone. I had the same assessment of the 6 Plus that I did with the Galaxy Note 3\\\\. See, I’m not an iPhone fanboy or an Android fanboy. I just like to use what works for me. The iPhone 4s has been working for me just fine for quite some time so I knew that if I selected the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus that would work fine for me too. But I wanted to keep looking…\\n\\nThen I stumbled upon the Motorola Droid wall and checked out the Moto X but it was the previous model. I also looked at the Droid MAXX, but I know that phone won’t be getting the Android L release. So long story short I passed up all of the Motorola devices.\\n\\nFinally, the LG wall. I haven’t used an LG phone for at least 4 years now. The last LG phone I had was the enV2\\\\. Remember those “text messaging” specialty phones? Yeah, the enV2 was one of them. The first LG phone I checked out was the LG G Vista.\\n\\n![](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/c380429e4f8ee27ae68024a319ee7f86/200510137/lg-g-vista-verizon-2014-07-31-01.jpg)\\n\\nThe screenshot above really doesn’t do the device justice. With a 5.7 inch screen size it is a HUGE device! Even larger than the Note 3\\\\. But it is pretty much a budget phablet with mid-range internals. I did like it at first, but then I did the screen readability test and it failed. ----- Here is one way to test screen resolution on a phone: Open the browser and navigate to news.ycombinator.com. Can you easily read the tiny text on the screen? If you notice pixelation then the screen resolution isn’t that high and you might want to pass. If you can read every single word without squinting then you’ve got a winner! ----- the G Vista was also a bit sluggish when opening apps and swiping from screen to screen. And the device was just too large for me (even the Note 3 was too large for me). But it was still a nice phone. Next to that was the LG G2\\\\.\\n\\n![](http://cdn3.pcadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/reviews/3471896/LG_G2.JPG)\\n\\nThe G2 is smaller in size than the G Vista, but is larger than the Samsung Galaxy S4\\\\. I love how the G2 felt in the hand and it was a little heavier than others but it still felt great and performed great. The back button placement was a bit strange to me but an interesting feature nonetheless.\\n\\nBut then next to that was the LG G3.\\n\\n![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BoqRouwCIAEjeZL.png)\\n\\nThis device has a 5.5 inch double 1080p screen and is wider than the Apple or Samsung phones, which I liked. I don’t really like the “tall” screens in the iPhones or the Note devices. I do prefer the wider screen. When I performed the screen readability test, the G3 passed it with flying colors as well. The back buttons on the G3 felt a lot better than the ones on the G2\\\\. I loaded up Beach Buggy Blitz (a great game to test out gaming performance on a mobile device) to get a feel for what type of gaming experience I could get on the phone too. I just kept falling in love with this device the longer I played with it. The camera was very responsive too.\\n\\n### The Moment of Truth: Why the LG G3?\\n\\nI went back to all of the phones I checked out before. It was a toss up between the iPhone 6 (not the 6 Plus) and the LG G3\\\\. If I selected the iPhone 6 I had a lot of benefits including:\\n\\n* Easier migration from my iPhone 4s\\n* I’m already familiar in how to work with iOS\\n* Met all of my current requirements\\n* Will have at least 3 years of software updates (seems to be the current support lifecycle for iOS)\\n\\nBut I still had a lot of reasons to NOT select the iPhone 6\\\\. I’ll give you three for now. First, I really REALLY don’t like the price. Maybe I’m too frugal but I think that paying $649 for a 16GB iPhone is WAY too much. Also, would it really kill Apple to increase the default storage to 32GB? Memory is incredibly cheap nowadays and 16GB just doesn’t cut it anymore. My second reason is that I don’t like being tied to a single ecosystem. iOS is locked down and a less ‘open’ system. Personally I don’t like that. And my third reason is iOS. I am just not a fan of iOS. The design from iOS6 to iOS7 was interesting, but it just doesn’t work for me. Also, since going to iOS7 my phone’s stability has drastically decreased (as explained above). So who’s to say that iOS 8 would be any better?\\n\\nAfter going back to each phone I kept on coming back to the LG G3\\\\. I just loved that phone. For me, it was about the things below:\\n\\n* Software: Even though it had some UI overlays, it felt pretty close to the stock Android OS which I loved. I knew that I could disable any apps or services I didn’t like (like NFL Mobile) and install a different keyboard, amongst other changes. Android is a more ‘open’ system as well so things can be changed to my liking. And with the large amount of apps in the Google Play store I could find any app to help me get most any job done.\\n* Screen size: I don’t like the “tall” iPhone screens. The G3 was a bit wider which I liked. The device isn’t quite a phablet, which is a good thing.\\n* Device build quality: The G3 just feels ‘right’. When you bend the device ever so slightly you can feel that LG put some time into designing this device to be durable, and it shows.\\n* Storage: The LG G3 comes with 32GB of storage, as well as a slot for a Micro SD card. The iPhone can’t match that…\\n* Gaming performance: Ok yeah, this was a big deal for me because I do game on my phones. The Mali 400 GPU works great on the G3 and appears to keep up with the latest in mobile 3D gaming titles. Playing Real Racing 3 and the Final Fantasy titles is a joy on the G3.\\n* Camera: The picture quality with the 13MP camera in the G3 was much better than the camera in the iPhone 6 ---- Well, it was much better in my opinion in my limited testing. And I thought the camera in the G3 was much better than the camera in the Note 3 too. I’ve already started taking pictures of my famliy with the G3 and it is worlds better than anything I’ve used in the past.\\n* The rear power and volume buttons: This was a surprising feature with the phone when I first used it. The power and volume buttons are on the back of the device. I’ve heard of people hating the back buttons on the G2\\\\. But for me, this was a selling feature of the G3 and one of the reasons why I chose the G3 over the others. I like the buttons on the back. They don’t get in the way of holding the phone and, in fact, make it easier to hold the phone in one hand.\\n* Battery Life: The LG G3 has a Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery, that equates to up to 14 hours of non-stop talk time. In recent tests the iPhone 6 caps out at 7.5 hours of non-stop talk time. Here is a better example: I’ve owned the G3 for two days now and charged it only once for 3 hours and I use it all the time to read email, game, and watch video. I still have to charge my iPhone 4s overnight as well as during the day even with light usage.\\n\\nI knew nothing about the G3 phone before I picked it up in the store. I checked out both the black and white models but eventually settled with the black model and am very happy with it.\\n\\n### Final Thoughts\\n\\nI was very opinionated when I walked into my Verizon store to look for a new phone. Also, I’m very picky on what I choose as my daily driver. But I’m very happy with my purchase because the G3 works for me. Some people have issues with the screen size, or that the back of the device is too slippery, or the back buttons are strange to them, but I don’t have any of those issues. So far, the only thing I don’t like about the phone has nothing to do with LG, it has to do with what Verizon did. First, Verizon doesn’t sell the LG G3 model with the Qi wireless charging compatible backing with the phone. It is a separate purchase. And second, yes there is quite a few Verizon app bloatware pre-installed on the phone image.

And rumor has it that Google will be releasing Android L in a few short months. So as you can see there has been quite a bit of talk about mobile. And with all of this talk, I’ve had mobile phone fever. It was time for me to select my next daily driver.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whyupgrade\">Why upgrade?</h2>\n<p>For the past year my daily driver has been the iPhone 4s.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.apple.com/lae/iphone-4s/specs/images/product_controls.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The reason why I’ve been using it is because my job provided me with it for work purposes. Over the past 14 months it more or less has gotten the job done. I’ve been able to respond to work emails, use the tethering here and there, and use Facetime when needed. However my 4s has been performing poorly much more often than normal. So naturally I’ve been wanting to upgrade to something else. For the curious, here is a list of the problems that I’ve been having with my 4s:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The external speaker has been cutting out at random times. When the phone rings, I only catch the calls half the time because the speaker never rings the call. I can’t narrow this down when or how the problem occurs, but it started after I upgraded the phone to iOS 7. I never had this problem when it was running iOS 6. I’ve read this is a common problem with the 4s…</li>\n<li>Phone performance has degraded quite a bit over the past year. There are various performance issues with my 4s where apps sometimes fail to open and I need to force close the app and try again. For example, the “Phone app” displays a grey screen instead of displaying the dialer sometimes. Yes, I do subscribe to podcasts and stream music daily. So I believe most of my performance problems is likely has to do with flash memory performance over time. The only solution for this is to get a newer device. For those that don’t know about why flash memory performance breaks down over time, I suggest you read this article.</li>\n<li>The small screen size doesn’t help. Sure I’ve been dealing with the 3.5 inch screen since last year and I’ve put up with it. But reading articles or reading emails on that tiny screen is really annoying. It is time to get something bigger.</li>\n<li>Battery life has severely degraded over the past year as well. When I first got the phone, a full charge in the morning allows me to use the 4s throughout the entire work day. This includes listening to a full hour of music or podcasts in the morning, making and taking iMessages and up to 5 phone calls (at 10 minutes per call) during the day, another hour of podcasting on my way home, and light usage until 8pm at night. I used to still have 30% battery life left at the end of the day. Nowadays my 4s would be dead before I leave the office to drive home --- and no, I don’t have Facebook installed on it and I don’t use GPS often.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So I’ve pretty much had enough with the iPhone 4s. It is time for me to upgrade! But to what device, and why?</p>\n<h2 id=\"myrequirements\">My Requirements</h2>\n<p>I came up with several requirements and my friends helped me write them down:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Large bright screen</li>\n<li>Video chat support for Facetime or Skype</li>\n<li>Long battery life</li>\n<li>Cisco AnyConnect in App Store</li>\n<li>Great camera with flash</li>\n<li>Chromecast support</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Right off the bat, I was a bit disappointed. Because of my requirements above I couldn’t choose a Windows Phone. I’ve heard of many people that love their Windows Phones, and I’ve heard of many people that hate them too. But I want to try a Windows Phone anyways and see how it goes for me. But without Chromecast supported apps or Cisco AnyConnect VPN I just can’t choose a Windows Phone – not right now. I’m a Verizon customer, so is most of my family and a large number of my colleagues. So I knew I was going to stick with Verizon again when I upgraded.</p>\n<h2 id=\"evaluation\">Evaluation</h2>\n<p>I walked into the Verizon store and looked at all of the devices available. First was the Samsung wall. I looked at the Galaxy Note 3 first.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.3g.co.uk/g_phones/large/samsung-galaxy-note-3-review-2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>It was in it’s folio case so I got to check out the entire feature set. The screen was nice and bright and it was very responsive. The phone is huge! But after playing around with it for a few minutes, for me it was just too big. Now I am a big guy myself – I’m 6’5 and 300 pounds, and I have huge hands too (I can easily palm an NBA regulation sized basketball). But the device just didn’t feel right in one hand. The more I evaluated the Note 3 I came to the conclusion that I would be forced to use it most of the time with 2 hands. I did like the Note 3 but I kept eyeing the phone next to it – the Galaxy S4.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.thedroidguy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Samsung-Galaxy-S4.jpg?617318\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>So I picked up the S4 and played around with it too. The S4 does have a very nice screen. But the device just didn’t feel right in my hands for some reason. The build quality was a bit questionable for my tastes, too ‘plasticy’. My wife has an S4 and she loves it but I’m picky. A Galaxy S5 was right next to the S4 so I checked that out too.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.t-mobile.com/content/dam/tmo/en-g/hotspot/rockford_hotspotflat_1240x700_mainimage.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I liked the screen and the look and feel of the S5 much more than the S4. The S5 was light in the hand, was very responsive, and felt more durable than the S4. Also the back cover of the phone was less prone to slipping out of the hand than the S4. A colleague of mine has the Galaxy S5 Active on AT&amp;T and he swears by it. He showed me a 1080p recording on it too, which was fantastic! I kept on playing around with the S5 and opened apps, called my phone to check the call quality, and took a few pics on the device just to see what it was like. My only gripe was that the Samsung devices still use TouchWiz UI which I do not like, but I could deal with it if needed. At this point the S5 was at the top of my list but I needed to check out the rest of the phones. I wanted to make sure I was making the right choice for me.</p>\n<p>Right next to the Galaxy devices was the HTC One M8 Windows edition.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/htc-one-m8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Man, that is a really really nice phone! It is metal, has two speakers on the front, and the screen was awesome. Then next to that was the Nokia Lumia Icon Windows phone.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cmsresources.windowsphone.com/windowsphone/en-US/cmpn/Nokia-Lumia-Icon/carousel/hero-state5.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I must say that trying to pick out either the HTC or the Lumia was like Sophie’s choice. It is really hard to pick the one over the other. But if I had to pick one, I’d choose the Lumia Icon. I just liked the Lumia Icon more than the HTC. But I was forced to pass them up because of my requirements. Sorry, maybe in a few months there will be Cisco AnyConnect support in Windows Phone…</p>\n<p>Next up was the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://images.bwbx.io/cms/2014-09-10/0910_iphone_swap_970-630x420.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I picked up the iPhone 6 first just to feel it in the hands and it did look and felt great. It was light, much lighter than my 4s to my surprise. It was responsive when swiping the screens, launching apps, and it took great pictures. The screen resolution and brightness was also fantastic. The whole device feels really good. I was also happy to see the iPhone 6 screen size. It seems like Apple finally got the right screen size for their phones in the iPhone 6. Right next to it was the iPhone 6 Plus. Just like the iPhone 6 it also felt great in the hand, but I put it down after 30 seconds. I just knew that I wasn’t going to select that phone. I had the same assessment of the 6 Plus that I did with the Galaxy Note 3. See, I’m not an iPhone fanboy or an Android fanboy. I just like to use what works for me. The iPhone 4s has been working for me just fine for quite some time so I knew that if I selected the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus that would work fine for me too. But I wanted to keep looking…</p>\n<p>Then I stumbled upon the Motorola Droid wall and checked out the Moto X but it was the previous model. I also looked at the Droid MAXX, but I know that phone won’t be getting the Android L release. So long story short I passed up all of the Motorola devices.</p>\n<p>Finally, the LG wall. I haven’t used an LG phone for at least 4 years now. The last LG phone I had was the enV2. Remember those “text messaging” specialty phones? Yeah, the enV2 was one of them. The first LG phone I checked out was the LG G Vista.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/c380429e4f8ee27ae68024a319ee7f86/200510137/lg-g-vista-verizon-2014-07-31-01.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The screenshot above really doesn’t do the device justice. With a 5.7 inch screen size it is a HUGE device! Even larger than the Note 3. But it is pretty much a budget phablet with mid-range internals. I did like it at first, but then I did the screen readability test and it failed. ----- Here is one way to test screen resolution on a phone: Open the browser and navigate to news.ycombinator.com. Can you easily read the tiny text on the screen? If you notice pixelation then the screen resolution isn’t that high and you might want to pass. If you can read every single word without squinting then you’ve got a winner! ----- the G Vista was also a bit sluggish when opening apps and swiping from screen to screen. And the device was just too large for me (even the Note 3 was too large for me). But it was still a nice phone. Next to that was the LG G2.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn3.pcadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/reviews/3471896/LG_G2.JPG\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The G2 is smaller in size than the G Vista, but is larger than the Samsung Galaxy S4. I love how the G2 felt in the hand and it was a little heavier than others but it still felt great and performed great. The back button placement was a bit strange to me but an interesting feature nonetheless.</p>\n<p>But then next to that was the LG G3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BoqRouwCIAEjeZL.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This device has a 5.5 inch double 1080p screen and is wider than the Apple or Samsung phones, which I liked. I don’t really like the “tall” screens in the iPhones or the Note devices. I do prefer the wider screen. When I performed the screen readability test, the G3 passed it with flying colors as well. The back buttons on the G3 felt a lot better than the ones on the G2. I loaded up Beach Buggy Blitz (a great game to test out gaming performance on a mobile device) to get a feel for what type of gaming experience I could get on the phone too. I just kept falling in love with this device the longer I played with it. The camera was very responsive too.</p>\n<h3 id=\"themomentoftruthwhythelgg3\">The Moment of Truth: Why the LG G3?</h3>\n<p>I went back to all of the phones I checked out before. It was a toss up between the iPhone 6 (not the 6 Plus) and the LG G3. If I selected the iPhone 6 I had a lot of benefits including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easier migration from my iPhone 4s</li>\n<li>I’m already familiar in how to work with iOS</li>\n<li>Met all of my current requirements</li>\n<li>Will have at least 3 years of software updates (seems to be the current support lifecycle for iOS)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But I still had a lot of reasons to NOT select the iPhone 6. I’ll give you three for now. First, I really REALLY don’t like the price. Maybe I’m too frugal but I think that paying $649 for a 16GB iPhone is WAY too much. Also, would it really kill Apple to increase the default storage to 32GB? Memory is incredibly cheap nowadays and 16GB just doesn’t cut it anymore. My second reason is that I don’t like being tied to a single ecosystem. iOS is locked down and a less ‘open’ system. Personally I don’t like that. And my third reason is iOS. I am just not a fan of iOS. The design from iOS6 to iOS7 was interesting, but it just doesn’t work for me. Also, since going to iOS7 my phone’s stability has drastically decreased (as explained above). So who’s to say that iOS 8 would be any better?</p>\n<p>After going back to each phone I kept on coming back to the LG G3. I just loved that phone. For me, it was about the things below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Software: Even though it had some UI overlays, it felt pretty close to the stock Android OS which I loved. I knew that I could disable any apps or services I didn’t like (like NFL Mobile) and install a different keyboard, amongst other changes. Android is a more ‘open’ system as well so things can be changed to my liking. And with the large amount of apps in the Google Play store I could find any app to help me get most any job done.</li>\n<li>Screen size: I don’t like the “tall” iPhone screens. The G3 was a bit wider which I liked. The device isn’t quite a phablet, which is a good thing.</li>\n<li>Device build quality: The G3 just feels ‘right’. When you bend the device ever so slightly you can feel that LG put some time into designing this device to be durable, and it shows.</li>\n<li>Storage: The LG G3 comes with 32GB of storage, as well as a slot for a Micro SD card. The iPhone can’t match that…</li>\n<li>Gaming performance: Ok yeah, this was a big deal for me because I do game on my phones. The Mali 400 GPU works great on the G3 and appears to keep up with the latest in mobile 3D gaming titles. Playing Real Racing 3 and the Final Fantasy titles is a joy on the G3.</li>\n<li>Camera: The picture quality with the 13MP camera in the G3 was much better than the camera in the iPhone 6 ---- Well, it was much better in my opinion in my limited testing. And I thought the camera in the G3 was much better than the camera in the Note 3 too. I’ve already started taking pictures of my famliy with the G3 and it is worlds better than anything I’ve used in the past.</li>\n<li>The rear power and volume buttons: This was a surprising feature with the phone when I first used it. The power and volume buttons are on the back of the device. I’ve heard of people hating the back buttons on the G2. But for me, this was a selling feature of the G3 and one of the reasons why I chose the G3 over the others. I like the buttons on the back. They don’t get in the way of holding the phone and, in fact, make it easier to hold the phone in one hand.</li>\n<li>Battery Life: The LG G3 has a Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery, that equates to up to 14 hours of non-stop talk time. In recent tests the iPhone 6 caps out at 7.5 hours of non-stop talk time. Here is a better example: I’ve owned the G3 for two days now and charged it only once for 3 hours and I use it all the time to read email, game, and watch video. I still have to charge my iPhone 4s overnight as well as during the day even with light usage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I knew nothing about the G3 phone before I picked it up in the store. I checked out both the black and white models but eventually settled with the black model and am very happy with it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"finalthoughts\">Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>I was very opinionated when I walked into my Verizon store to look for a new phone. Also, I’m very picky on what I choose as my daily driver. But I’m very happy with my purchase because the G3 works for me. Some people have issues with the screen size, or that the back of the device is too slippery, or the back buttons are strange to them, but I don’t have any of those issues. So far, the only thing I don’t like about the phone has nothing to do with LG, it has to do with what Verizon did. First, Verizon doesn’t sell the LG G3 model with the Qi wireless charging compatible backing with the phone. It is a separate purchase. And second, yes there is quite a few Verizon app bloatware pre-installed on the phone image. But the good news is that you can disable the ones you don’t need or use.</p>\n<p>After I picked up the G3, one of my friends shot me a message telling me that LG has a promotion right now where they will send a free 2nd battery and charger when you purchase a new G3! A great deal indeed. I’ve already started to look up the wireless charging and bluetooth accessories for the LG G3 as well. I’m looking forward to using the G3 for a while.</p>\n<p>Sorry if this seemed like a sales pitch for the G3. This is just my experience.

Also, would it really\nkill Apple to increase the default storage to 32GB? Memory is incredibly cheap\nnowadays and 16GB just doesn’t cut it anymore. My second reason is that I don’t\nlike being tied to a single ecosystem. iOS is locked down and a less ‘open’\nsystem. Personally I don’t like that. And my third reason is iOS. I am just not\na fan of iOS. The design from iOS6 to iOS7 was interesting, but it just doesn’t\nwork for me. Also, since going to iOS7 my phone’s stability has drastically\ndecreased (as explained above). So who’s to say that iOS 8 would be any better?\n\nAfter going back to each phone I kept on coming back to the LG G3. I just loved\nthat phone. For me, it was about the things below:\n\n * Software: Even though it had some UI overlays, it felt pretty close to the\n   stock Android OS which I loved. I knew that I could disable any apps or\n   services I didn’t like (like NFL Mobile) and install a different keyboard,\n   amongst other changes. Android is a more ‘open’ system as well so things can\n   be changed to my liking. And with the large amount of apps in the Google Play\n   store I could find any app to help me get most any job done.\n * Screen size: I don’t like the “tall” iPhone screens. The G3 was a bit wider\n   which I liked. The device isn’t quite a phablet, which is a good thing.\n * Device build quality: The G3 just feels ‘right’. When you bend the device\n   ever so slightly you can feel that LG put some time into designing this\n   device to be durable, and it shows.\n * Storage: The LG G3 comes with 32GB of storage, as well as a slot for a Micro\n   SD card. The iPhone can’t match that…\n * Gaming performance: Ok yeah, this was a big deal for me because I do game on\n   my phones. The Mali 400 GPU works great on the G3 and appears to keep up with\n   the latest in mobile 3D gaming titles. Playing Real Racing 3 and the Final\n   Fantasy titles is a joy on the G3.\n * Camera: The picture quality with the 13MP camera in the G3 was much better\n   than the camera in the iPhone 6 ---- Well, it was much better in my opinion\n   in my limited testing. And I thought the camera in the G3 was much better\n   than the camera in the Note 3 too. I’ve already started taking pictures of my\n   famliy with the G3 and it is worlds better than anything I’ve used in the\n   past.\n * The rear power and volume buttons: This was a surprising feature with the\n   phone when I first used it. The power and volume buttons are on the back of\n   the device. I’ve heard of people hating the back buttons on the G2. But for\n   me, this was a selling feature of the G3 and one of the reasons why I chose\n   the G3 over the others. I like the buttons on the back. They don’t get in the\n   way of holding the phone and, in fact, make it easier to hold the phone in\n   one hand.\n * Battery Life: The LG G3 has a Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery, that equates to up to\n   14 hours of non-stop talk time. In recent tests the iPhone 6 caps out at 7.5\n   hours of non-stop talk time. Here is a better example: I’ve owned the G3 for\n   two days now and charged it only once for 3 hours and I use it all the time\n   to read email, game, and watch video. I still have to charge my iPhone 4s\n   overnight as well as during the day even with light usage.\n\nI knew nothing about the G3 phone before I picked it up in the store. I checked\nout both the black and white models but eventually settled with the black model\nand am very happy with it.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI was very opinionated when I walked into my Verizon store to look for a new\nphone. Also, I’m very picky on what I choose as my daily driver. But I’m very\nhappy with my purchase because the G3 works for me. Some people have issues with\nthe screen size, or that the back of the device is too slippery, or the back\nbuttons are strange to them, but I don’t have any of those issues. So far, the\nonly thing I don’t like about the phone has nothing to do with LG, it has to do\nwith what Verizon did. First, Verizon doesn’t sell the LG G3 model with the Qi\nwireless charging compatible backing with the phone. It is a separate purchase.\nAnd second, yes there is quite a few Verizon app bloatware pre-installed on the\nphone image. But the good news is that you can disable the ones you don’t need\nor use.\n\nAfter I picked up the G3, one of my friends shot me a message telling me that LG\nhas a promotion right now where they will send a free 2nd battery and charger\nwhen you purchase a new G3! A great deal indeed. I’ve already started to look up\nthe wireless charging and bluetooth accessories for the LG G3 as well. I’m\nlooking forward to using the G3 for a while.\n\nSorry if this seemed like a sales pitch for the G3. This is just my experience.\nMaybe in the future I’ll jump ship back to iPhone, but for now LG definitely has\na winner.\n\n * Joe","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2014-09-26T03:18:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2014-09-26T03:18:05.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2014-09-26T03:18:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdcc37","uuid":"6bd72cae-ef33-4561-bc43-e670e40906e7","title":"Language Used in Discussion about Net Neutrality and Peering","slug":"language_used_in_discussion_about_net_neutrality_and_peering-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"**< Please see my disclaimers at the bottom of this article. >**A great deal of the discussions about net neutrality and the Netflix peering deals have me concerned because of the language people have chosen to use when discussing these topics.

Like thousands of other organizations, we use SolarWinds SAM to monitor a wide array of infrastructure and business applications. Recently we ran into a snag with trying to monitor one of our more critical apps, so I'd like to share how\\\\what we did to resolve that problem using Windows Powershell.... \\n\\nOne of our critical applications runs for a few hours each day starting at 6am then closes on its own anywhere from 10am or 4pm or even 2am the next day. When the application process finishes and closes depends on the day the application is launched - some days have more data to process than the others. In addition, there cannot be more than one instance of this application running at one time or the 4 or 10 or 24 hour process will have to start all over (which will delay some of our core business units' daily numbers). This poses a unique problem when trying to monitor this application in SolarWinds SAM. \\n\\nHere is the biggest limitation of any application monitoring solution --- SAM expects an application to always be up\\\\running in order for the alerts to properly work and also to show if the application is up\\\\down on the web dashboard. This isn't only the default way SolarWinds SAM monitors applications, it is by design. Unfortunately there isn't an out-of-the-box solution for monitoring applications \\\"intermittently\\\". To be perfectly honest, I'm not surprised that SolarWinds SAM would include such a feature out-of-the-box. I mean, why the heck would you want to monitor an application only \\\"part of the time\\\" anyways? Trying to set up a proper alert for an intermittent application would be troublesome if not impossible. But this is just what I need to do with this specific business application. Also, I needed to monitor if there are more than one instance of the application running on the server. The default app monitors in SAM just won't suit my needs here. Instead, what I needed to do was utilize the feature in SAM where I can create my own custom app monitor using a script. And Windows Powershell does the job nicely. \\n\\nI created a Windows Powershell script that finds out how many instances of the application's Windows process is running at the same time returns the value in the variable $stat, only if the process is running. Here is a copy of the script text: \\n\\n**# Change 'Notepad' to the process name of your liking. Remember to include the single quotes. \\n$processname = 'Notepad' \\n$process = Get-Process $processname -ErrorAction silentlycontinue** \\n**if ($process) \\n{ \\n\\n$count = @($process).Count \\n\\n$msg = \\\"$count instances of $processname running.\\\" \\n\\n$stat = $count   \\n}** \\n**else \\n{ \\n\\n$msg = \\\"$processname is not running.\\\" \\n\\n$stat = 0 \\n} \\nWrite-Host $msg \\nWrite-Host \\\"Statistic: $stat\\\"** \\n\\nThe script is simple but powerful. First, the script determines if the process name 'Notepad' (defined in $processname) is running at all. If it is, then it will find out the current instance count and store it in the variable $stat. If the process is not running, then $stat will equal a numeric '0'. Finally, we write the message information and statistic information to the screen. The message ($msg variable) is just for SolarWinds SAM use - it is something to display in the dashboard instead of leaving a big question mark on the app monitor details view. The $stat variable is the important one since this is the numeric value needed by SAM. We set the threshold to '1' in the SAM settings for this monitor. When the threshold is reached an alert will be generated in SolarWinds. Bada boom bada bing. \\n\\nThis monitor works great for us since it helps us utilize SAM without circumventing the way it works. The script monitor is in 'good' status (or 'green' status) when the value is 0 or 1, which is exactly what we expect because either the application is not running at the time the script is executed or there should only be one instance of the process running. We only want to know if there are 2 or more instances of the process running on the computer - nothing else. We have to use a different application monitor in SAM to find out if this 6am process did not execute when we needed it to, so I'm not concerned about including that information here at this time :) \\n\\nThis script can be used not only in SolarWinds SAM, but your own custom solutions or projects. It is designed to be extremely easy to modify. The only thing you have to change is the $processname!

In addition,\nthere cannot be more than one instance of this application running at one time\nor the 4 or 10 or 24 hour process will have to start all over (which will delay\nsome of our core business units' daily numbers). This poses a unique problem\nwhen trying to monitor this application in SolarWinds SAM.\n\nHere is the biggest limitation of any application monitoring solution --- SAM\nexpects an application to always be up\\running in order for the alerts to\nproperly work and also to show if the application is up\\down on the web\ndashboard. This isn't only the default way SolarWinds SAM monitors applications,\nit is by design. Unfortunately there isn't an out-of-the-box solution for\nmonitoring applications \"intermittently\". To be perfectly honest, I'm not\nsurprised that SolarWinds SAM would include such a feature out-of-the-box. I\nmean, why the heck would you want to monitor an application only \"part of the\ntime\" anyways? Trying to set up a proper alert for an intermittent application\nwould be troublesome if not impossible. But this is just what I need to do with\nthis specific business application. Also, I needed to monitor if there are more\nthan one instance of the application running on the server. The default app\nmonitors in SAM just won't suit my needs here. Instead, what I needed to do was\nutilize the feature in SAM where I can create my own custom app monitor using a\nscript. And Windows Powershell does the job nicely.\n\nI created a Windows Powershell script that finds out how many instances of the\napplication's Windows process is running at the same time returns the value in\nthe variable $stat, only if the process is running. Here is a copy of the script\ntext:\n\n# Change 'Notepad' to the process name of your liking. Remember to include the\nsingle quotes.\n$processname = 'Notepad'\n$process = Get-Process $processname -ErrorAction silentlycontinue\n**if ($process)\n{\n\n$count = @($process).Count\n\n$msg = \"$count instances of $processname running.\"\n\n$stat = $count\n}**\n**else\n{\n\n$msg = \"$processname is not running.\"\n\n$stat = 0\n}\nWrite-Host $msg\nWrite-Host \"Statistic: $stat\"**\n\nThe script is simple but powerful. First, the script determines if the process\nname 'Notepad' (defined in $processname) is running at all. If it is, then it\nwill find out the current instance count and store it in the variable $stat. If\nthe process is not running, then $stat will equal a numeric '0'. Finally, we\nwrite the message information and statistic information to the screen. The\nmessage ($msg variable) is just for SolarWinds SAM use - it is something to\ndisplay in the dashboard instead of leaving a big question mark on the app\nmonitor details view. The $stat variable is the important one since this is the\nnumeric value needed by SAM. We set the threshold to '1' in the SAM settings for\nthis monitor. When the threshold is reached an alert will be generated in\nSolarWinds. Bada boom bada bing.\n\nThis monitor works great for us since it helps us utilize SAM without\ncircumventing the way it works. The script monitor is in 'good' status (or\n'green' status) when the value is 0 or 1, which is exactly what we expect\nbecause either the application is not running at the time the script is executed\nor there should only be one instance of the process running. We only want to\nknow if there are 2 or more instances of the process running on the computer -\nnothing else. We have to use a different application monitor in SAM to find out\nif this 6am process did not execute when we needed it to, so I'm not concerned\nabout including that information here at this time :)\n\nThis script can be used not only in SolarWinds SAM, but your own custom\nsolutions or projects. It is designed to be extremely easy to modify. The only\nthing you have to change is the $processname! Just change ‘Notepad’ to some\nother process name!\n\nIf you find this Powershell script useful I'd love to know how you use it in\nyour own environment. Or if you modified the script I'd love to hear what you\ndid with it.\n\nI hope this helps you create a solution in your own environment.\n\nliterally wrote the book on SolarWinds Orion NPM\n[http://www.amazon.com/SolarWinds-Orion-Network-Performance-Monitor-ebook/dp/B00BKZHDNQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1398736782&sr=8-1&keywords=solarwinds]","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2014-04-29T01:34:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2014-04-29T02:01:24.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2014-04-29T01:34:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdcc39","uuid":"b8e73419-93be-4d68-86ed-6b6747149431","title":"How Much Fun are You Having on the Job?","slug":"how_much_fun_are_you_having_on_the_job-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Imagine that you are talking with your boss, or a possible employer, or friend, family member, or even a complete stranger about what you do for a living.

There are times where someone does not do something they are supposed to do and it affects my work. I have to deal with irate customers and I have many different people that jump down my throat about various issues here and there. There are even times where I make mistakes and it affects other people's work! In my past I have even made mistakes that cost me my job. None of these things helped reduce my stress level. None. Just imagine if I had these negative thoughts all day long. I doubt anyone would want to talk to me, let alone work with me. Do you know what these negative thoughts about our jobs do to our perception about our workplace, or our bosses, or the businesses we work for? It impacts the way we work, how we work, and it impacts the quality of work that we produce. These thoughts set us up for failure and causes increased stress in the workplace. \\nIn 2010, The American Psychological Association published a that displayed some very interesting research done about workplace stress. Here are a few of them: \\n\\n* 69% of employees say their work is a significant source of stress in their lives.\\n* 51% of employees say they were less productive due to stress.\\n* Health care expenses for employees with high levels of stress were 46% higher compared to those without.\\n* Job stress is estimated to cost U.S. industry more than $300 billion a year in absenteeism, turnover, diminished productivity and medical, legal and insurance costs.\\n\\nThese are some very substantial numbers and facts and simply put -- they are **DISTURBING**.

If I wake up in\nthe morning, and I PLAN on having a great day at work that day then I will have\na great day! When I plan on having fun at work, it affects not only myself but\nmy attitude affects everyone around me too. There is this tremendous positive\nenergy that flows outward from myself towards others. This positive energy helps\nme to perform well at my tasks and projects. And when I perform well on the job,\nI feel a sense accomplishment and personal satisfaction in the work that I do. I\nhave this sense of empowerment and feel that I have a long future in the\ncompany. When I have fun on the job I feel that I am a valuable team member in\nmy workplace. Ladies and gentleman, this type of positive attitude is\ncontagious. Everyone around me lights up. My colleagues are happy to work with\nme to achieve my goals and I am more than happy to help them achieve their own\ngoals.\n\n\"But Joe, you just don't understand my situation. It just isn't that easy to\n'flip the switch' and just feel good about my job.\" I know it isn't easy but the\nmore you work on your own attitude about work, the better it will get. If you\nare in a constant struggle with your boss or your place of employment or you\nstill find it difficult to have fun on the job no matter what you do, I\nrecommend you read the article by my good friend at . You are never stuck. There\nis always a way out of the rut that you are in. My point is this...\n\n\"If you target nothing, you'll hit it every time.\" - Zig Ziglar\nI want you to wake up tomorrow and plan on having fun on the job.  If you do\nthis every day I guarantee that it will make a tremendous difference in your\ncareer. Your co-workers and your bosses will notice the difference as well. And\nyou know what? When you plan on having fun at your job, and you actually HAVE\nFUN, I guarantee that you will make a positive impact on someone else that might\nhave negative thoughts about their job.\n\nPlan on having fun on the job so that you not only make a difference in your own\ncareer, but your colleagues' careers too.\n\nEquipYourLife.org [https://www.blogger.com/www.equipyourlife.org]","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2014-04-10T04:04:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2014-04-16T13:07:42.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2014-04-10T04:04:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdcc3a","uuid":"7f653320-bded-4d87-b082-f83fcdb55a67","title":"My Personal Development and Learning Resources","slug":"my_personal_development_and_learning_resources-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I read a lot.\\n\\nMost of my work day involves reading the onslaught of business email, alert messages, text messages and instant messages, vendor documentation, knowledgebase articles, and many other types of documentation related to my job.

But both SQL Server 2012 had tons of errors and Sharepoint 2013 wouldn't display any web pages and displayed nothing but HTTP 500 errors. Shoot, what was I to do? Damage control mode. I was left with unusable SQL database and a broken Sharepoint server. Not good.\\n\\nFirst things first, I reverted back to the saved snapshot for the SQL Server. Once that was done and after I confirmed the SQL server was back in good operating condition it was time to focus on Sharepoint 2013.\\n\\nAfter several hours of trying several things, here was our fix:\\n\\n* Install SharePoint Server 2013 Service Pack 1, then reboot.\\n* Run the SharePoint Product Configuration Wizard to finish the upgrade. Reboot when prompted.\\n* Verify SharePoint sites come up without a problem.\\n\\nThe environment was finally back up and running with no more errors. From this point we made snapshots of each virtual machine then continued to perform the 2012 R2 in-place OS upgrades.\\n\\nIf you want to perform an in-place upgrade your servers from 2012 RTM to 2012 R2, this can be done successfully for most cases since 2012 to 2012 R2 in-place upgrades are supported by Microsoft. If your 2012 RTM servers are running SQL Server 2012 RTM or SharePoint Server 2013 RTM, then read the following:\\n\\n## Upgrading to Windows Server 2012 R2 from 2012 RTM for servers running SQL Server 2012 RTM.\\n\\n* First install SQL Server 2012 Service Pack 1\\\\.

If your 2012 RTM servers are running SQL\nServer 2012 RTM or SharePoint Server 2013 RTM, then read the following:\n\nUpgrading to Windows Server 2012 R2 from 2012 RTM for servers running SQL Server\n2012 RTM.\n * First install SQL Server 2012 Service Pack 1. Reboot when prompted.\n * Execute setup.exe from the Windows Server 2012 R2 installation media.\n   Complete the upgrade.\n * Done.\n\nUpgrading to Windows Server 2012 R2 from 2012 RTM for servers running Sharepoint\nServer 2013 RTM.\n * First install SharePoint Server 2013 Service Pack 1. Reboot when prompted.\n * Run Sharepoint Configuration Wizard to complete the upgrade. Reboot when\n   prompted.\n * Execute setup.exe from the Windows Server 2012 R2 installation media.\n   Complete the upgrade.\n * Install available Windows Updates after you can log in for the first time.\n   Reboot when prompted.\n * Run the Sharepoint Configuration Wizard again. Reboot when prompted.\n * Done.\n\nPerforming an in-place upgrade to Windows Server 2012 R2 FROM a 2012 RTM server\nworks just fine and, yes, to save time and resources I would recommend doing\nthis if you have the ability to do so. The only problem is that it can take\nseveral hours for the in-place upgrade to finish per server, but it does work.\nAs always, make sure you read Microsoft's official documentation on TechNet for\nyour specific upgrade situation. Don't make the same mistakes that I did :)\n\n * Joe","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2014-03-07T23:00:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2014-03-07T23:00:01.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2014-03-07T23:00:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdcc3c","uuid":"b5df1310-d3b6-4c46-8336-ee7c1871f081","title":"Some Things I’ve Learned While Working in Enterprise IT","slug":"some_things_i_ve_learned_while_working_in_enterprise_it-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ofUDUOdFvUw/UPh98VYdYbI/AAAAAAAAAEs/QIPHl42nxpY/s1600/lightbulb4_0140.png)Even though many would argue with me, I don't really consider myself a success story.

But instead of adding another SSID to my wireless network and doing 802.1X, can't I just setup DirectAccess for my Windows computers instead?\\\" \\n\\nDirectAccess and 802.1X authentication serve two different types of purposes. Now, both technologies require certificates and both require some type of authentication to take place. But each technology is used for very different reasons. \\n\\n802.1X is used for securing a wired or wireless network by enforcing user and\\\\or computer authentication in order to gain network access. Essentially, 802.1X is used for network access control (NAC). There are various ways to implement 802.1X, but the point I am trying to make here is that it is used to encrypt network traffic in addition to only allowing authorized devices access to the network. All traffic that passes through the 802.1X secured network is encrypted (thanks to it's certificate-based requirement) which is why it is widely used on BYOD wireless networks in the enterprise. \\n\\nThe benefits of setting up 802.1X authentication are many. Here are a few: \\n\\n* Only allow authorized users and computers access to the network.\\n* All network traffic on 802.1X networks are encrypted between the client and the authentication system.\\n* 802.1X networks are more difficult to eavesdrop on (by using Wireshark or other packet capture tools).\\n* If the 802.1X certificate is not on the computer, the computer is not trusted and network access will be denied.\\n* Depending on the 802.1X solution used, you can do 'posturing' and perform more granular and\\\\or dynamic control of network access per person or per device.\\n\\nEven with all of the good things that 802.1X can provide, there are several drawbacks. \\n\\n* A device must support joining 802.1X networks. Mac, Windows, Linux, Apple IOS, and Android are known to support 802.1X. But, gaming devices such as Xbox and Playstation do not.\\n* Takes more time to troubleshoot when users complain of issues.\\n* 802.1X is an IEEE standard but every network vendor has their own way of implementing it. So however you choose to set up 802.1X, it won't be the same process with another vendor.\\n\\nDirectAccess serves a very different purpose. It is a VPN-like technology that forces a Windows computer that is a member of an Active Directory domain to connect to it's home domain over an SSL tunnel (just like what a VPN connection does) but it does this automatically, in the background, without any user intervention. It is for this reason alone why DirectAccess is worth the time to give it a serious look and consider dropping other VPN solutions, especially if your organization is a \\\"Windows shop\\\". The moment the computer has an active internet connection (no matter where it is in the world) it establishes a secure SSL connection with the DirectAccess server. The DirectAccess server is essentially a proxy between the client and internal enterprise network resources. \\n\\nThere are plenty of benefits to setting up DirectAccess on your domain as well. Here are a few. \\n\\n* Windows is preconfigured for DirectAccess by Group Policy; no configuration is needed by the user. The user only needs to get the computer connected to the internet via Ethernet cable or WiFi and Windows will take care of the rest silently and in the background.\\n* Ability to manage the desktop computer as if it is physically connected on-premise. This includes Group Policy enforcement, Active Directory, the user's ability to access internal network resources, and so on.\\n* You can remotely join a PC to the Active Directory domain (Windows 8 only).\\n* No need to finagle with KMS or MAK licensing for the desktop. With DirectAccess, you only need KMS.\\n* Communication between the Windows client and the DirectAccess server is secured.\\n* Relatively easy to set up. Not as complex as traditional VPN solutions (such as Cisco ASA) can be.\\n* No additional licensing needed. If your computers are licensed to connect to your Windows Servers then you are all set.\\n* When coupled with Windows Server's Network Access Policies, you can perform NAC-like tasks such as 'posturing'.\\n\\nBut, there are still some drawbacks to DirectAccess. \\n\\n* DirectAccess is only supported on Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 7 Enterprise, and Windows 8 Enterprise computers.\\n* The Windows computer must be joined to an Active Directory domain.\\n* DirectAccess will not work for MAC or Linux computers - only Windows. For those operating systems, a traditional VPN connection is required.\\n* If Force Tunneling is disabled in the DirectAccess configuration, then only the network traffic between the client and DA server will be secured. All other traffic will pass directly through to the internet instead of through the DirectAccess tunnel.\\n\\nDon't miss that last note. If you are allowing \\\"Split Tunneling\\\" with your DA clients, then you really aren't securing all of the network traffic from the client. This is why you would still need 802.1X. Another reason why you would still want to use 802.1X is to enforce authentication just to gain network access. \\n\\nSo, in a nut shell, you would implement 802.1X to secure all network traffic on your wired and\\\\or wireless networks but you would not use 802.1X to enforce your computers to connect to your internal network. You would implement DirectAccess for one of two reasons. The first is to make it easier for your Windows computers, or to enforce your Windows computers, to connect to your internal network via VPN. The second reason is if you intend to replace your existing VPN solutions entirely. You would not use DirectAccess to secure network communications on your wired or wireless networks. \\n\\nI hope this helps some of you out with your current projects or questions regarding the subject matter. \\n\\n- Joe\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Here is a question that came to me earlier and caused me to think a bit....</p>\n<p>&quot;I am creating a new SSID with the intent of setting up an 802.1X wireless network to secure traffic between the WiFi access points and each client.

But\ninstead of adding another SSID to my wireless network and doing 802.1X, can't I\njust setup DirectAccess for my Windows computers instead?\"\n\nDirectAccess and 802.1X authentication serve two different types of purposes.\nNow, both technologies require certificates and both require some type of\nauthentication to take place. But each technology is used for very different\nreasons.\n\n802.1X is used for securing a wired or wireless network by enforcing user and\\or\ncomputer authentication in order to gain network access. Essentially, 802.1X is\nused for network access control (NAC). There are various ways to implement\n802.1X, but the point I am trying to make here is that it is used to encrypt\nnetwork traffic in addition to only allowing authorized devices access to the\nnetwork. All traffic that passes through the 802.1X secured network is encrypted\n(thanks to it's certificate-based requirement) which is why it is widely used on\nBYOD wireless networks in the enterprise.\n\nThe benefits of setting up 802.1X authentication are many. Here are a few:\n\n * Only allow authorized users and computers access to the network.\n * All network traffic on 802.1X networks are encrypted between the client and\n   the authentication system.\n * 802.1X networks are more difficult to eavesdrop on (by using Wireshark or\n   other packet capture tools).\n * If the 802.1X certificate is not on the computer, the computer is not trusted\n   and network access will be denied.\n * Depending on the 802.1X solution used, you can do 'posturing' and perform\n   more granular and\\or dynamic control of network access per person or per\n   device.\n\nEven with all of the good things that 802.1X can provide, there are several\ndrawbacks.\n\n * A device must support joining 802.1X networks. Mac, Windows, Linux, Apple\n   IOS, and Android are known to support 802.1X. But, gaming devices such as\n   Xbox and Playstation do not.\n * Takes more time to troubleshoot when users complain of issues.\n * 802.1X is an IEEE standard but every network vendor has their own way of\n   implementing it. So however you choose to set up 802.1X, it won't be the same\n   process with another vendor.\n\nDirectAccess serves a very different purpose. It is a VPN-like technology that\nforces a Windows computer that is a member of an Active Directory domain to\nconnect to it's home domain over an SSL tunnel (just like what a VPN connection\ndoes) but it does this automatically, in the background, without any user\nintervention. It is for this reason alone why DirectAccess is worth the time to\ngive it a serious look and consider dropping other VPN solutions, especially if\nyour organization is a \"Windows shop\". The moment the computer has an active\ninternet connection (no matter where it is in the world) it establishes a secure\nSSL connection with the DirectAccess server. The DirectAccess server is\nessentially a proxy between the client and internal enterprise network\nresources.\n\nThere are plenty of benefits to setting up DirectAccess on your domain as well.\nHere are a few.\n\n * Windows is preconfigured for DirectAccess by Group Policy; no configuration\n   is needed by the user. The user only needs to get the computer connected to\n   the internet via Ethernet cable or WiFi and Windows will take care of the\n   rest silently and in the background.\n * Ability to manage the desktop computer as if it is physically connected\n   on-premise. This includes Group Policy enforcement, Active Directory, the\n   user's ability to access internal network resources, and so on.\n * You can remotely join a PC to the Active Directory domain (Windows 8 only).\n * No need to finagle with KMS or MAK licensing for the desktop. With\n   DirectAccess, you only need KMS.\n * Communication between the Windows client and the DirectAccess server is\n   secured.\n * Relatively easy to set up. Not as complex as traditional VPN solutions (such\n   as Cisco ASA) can be.\n * No additional licensing needed. If your computers are licensed to connect to\n   your Windows Servers then you are all set.\n * When coupled with Windows Server's Network Access Policies, you can perform\n   NAC-like tasks such as 'posturing'.\n\nBut, there are still some drawbacks to DirectAccess.\n\n * DirectAccess is only supported on Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 7 Enterprise,\n   and Windows 8 Enterprise computers.\n * The Windows computer must be joined to an Active Directory domain.\n * DirectAccess will not work for MAC or Linux computers - only Windows. For\n   those operating systems, a traditional VPN connection is required.\n * If Force Tunneling is disabled in the DirectAccess configuration, then only\n   the network traffic between the client and DA server will be secured. All\n   other traffic will pass directly through to the internet instead of through\n   the DirectAccess tunnel.\n\nDon't miss that last note. If you are allowing \"Split Tunneling\" with your DA\nclients, then you really aren't securing all of the network traffic from the\nclient. This is why you would still need 802.1X. Another reason why you would\nstill want to use 802.1X is to enforce authentication just to gain network\naccess.\n\nSo, in a nut shell, you would implement 802.1X to secure all network traffic\non your wired and\\or wireless networks but you would not use 802.1X to enforce\nyour computers to connect to your internal network. You would implement\nDirectAccess for one of two reasons. The first is to make it easier for your\nWindows computers, or to enforce your Windows computers, to connect to your\ninternal network via VPN. The second reason is if you intend to replace your\nexisting VPN solutions entirely. You would not use DirectAccess to secure\nnetwork communications on your wired or wireless networks.\n\nI hope this helps some of you out with your current projects or questions\nregarding the subject matter.\n\n * Joe","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2013-07-21T01:38:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2013-07-21T01:51:42.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2013-07-21T01:38:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdcc3e","uuid":"941012d0-9389-48b9-9ee4-3bacbd8a3e1d","title":"Cannot enable the Windows Firewall in Windows 7, error code 0x807042c","slug":"cannot_enable_the_windows_firewall_in_windows_7_error_code_0_x_807042_c-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"This is a short post for tonight.

First, there are a few things you need to check:\\n\\n1\\\\. Enable all three firewall profiles in Windows Firewall with Advanced Security on the DirectAccess server. The **Windows Firewall cannot be disabled** whatsoever due to the fact that IPSec policies (a prerequisite for DirectAccess) requires an active Windows Firewall to work.\\n\\n2\\\\. Allow inbound ports 80, 443, and 62000 through Windows Firewall with Advanced Security on the DirectAccess server. These ports must be allowed from the internet.\\n\\n3\\\\. When using the single network adapter installation of DirectAccess, this means your DA server is behind NAT. On your external router\\\\firewall, ensure ports 80, 443, and 62000 are forwarded to the DirectAccess server (a.k.a. port forwarding).\\n\\nThis issue all has to do with how you initially configured the Remote Access Server settings in Step 2 of the configuration wizard. In the Remote Access Administration Console, click on Configuration then click the Edit button under Step 2\\\\.

There are teams for development, server, network, help desk, and so forth. At the time of this writing, I am a member of the network engineering team. Our entire I.T. organization also uses the same work order system or \\\"ticket system\\\" for tracking issues, problems, and user requests. In each \\\"ticket\\\", we are all expected to make notes and track our work especially adding in our troubleshooting notes and what we did to resolve the ticket.

I also expect these questions to be answered by myself and yes, I do make mistakes sometimes. But I want to bring up an internal problem that we all face too often in our I.T. roles where we completely drop the ball on writing decent documentation. \\nSo, what are some examples of poor documentation in a help desk ticket? Here are a few: \\n\\n#1\\\\. The help desk receives a call from a customer\\\\user about a problem with their computer where they cannot access the internet. From the activity logs, we see that the ticket remains in the help desk queue for several hours, and is then simply assigned to the Desktop support team to resolve with no troubleshooting notes. Then, a person on the desktop support team takes ownership of the ticket. The ticket sits in their work order queue for a few more hours, then that person assigns it to the network team with a note that says something to the effect of \\\"PC can't get online. Please check the wall jack.\\\" This is where the activity trail ends. \\n\\n#2\\\\. A desktop support team member creates a new ticket for a user because the user is unable to print to a network printer in their department. According to the activity log in the ticket, the desktop support team member noted the error that appears onscreen when trying to print from the user's computer and also has a screenshot attached to the ticket. The ticket was in the desktop support ticket queue for one hour, then was escalated to the server team with a note asking them to reboot the print server. \\n\\n#3\\\\. An developer on the web applications team opens a ticket for a customer and assigns it to desktop support asking them to assist a customer that is having issues trying to access the company's website.  There are no further notes and no details about the problem the customer is experiencing. \\n\\nIn the first scenario, we don't know if this is a widespread issue or if this is a problem localized to the customer's computer. We also have no idea what troubleshooting was done by the help desk or the desktop support team member. The network team member must now go through troubleshooting 101 all over again because there was no information on what was done in the ticket. \\n\\nThe second scenario is similar to the first. The first question that should have been answered in this ticket is \\\"Is this a widespread problem, or is only this person having a printing problem?\\\" Long story short, the problem was local to the desktop (Windows Print Spooler problem) and should have been handled at the front end. \\n\\nThe third scenario highlights internal communication problems. Sure, there are good reasons why developers shouldn't be contacting a customer directly. But the developer needs to help guide the desktop support technician in the right direction so they aren't entirely lost. \\n\\nBased on the information from the scenarios above, it is clear there is a serious breakdown of providing proper documentation. We all are very busy and we all do work very hard, but having a lack of documentation hurts everyone. Saying the \\\"I don't have the time\\\" excuse isn't an excuse at all - it is a cop out. The primary rule of working in work orders or help desk tickets is this: \\n\\n**If it isn't in the ticket, it never happened.** Just imagine that you were working on a problem for a customer and you resolved the problem and closed out the ticket without putting in your work notes. If the customer called back to complain they are still having the same problem, it would appear that you literally didn't do any work. Now imagine that you are working for a company that was being wrongfully sued by a customer due to a ticket you worked on. If you had proper documentation, you would have little to worry about. The second rule about documentation in help desk tickets is also very simple: \\n\\n**The ticket needs to tell a story.** Work notes in a ticket need to be meaningful and somewhat easy to understand in case someone else reads your notes (especially your manager). Proper notes in help desk tickets is usually proof that you are working hard, as well as learning on the job. What you or your boss should be able to do is open a closed\\\\resolved ticket and very easily be able to read out who did what in that ticket, as well as read the actual resolution of the ticket, almost like it is a story. \\n\\nLeaving out the resolution in a ticket and just saying \\\"Fixed\\\" or \\\"Done\\\" doesn't count as a proper resolution to the story. \\n\\nMake it count. \\n<u>Some facts about help desk tickets:</u> \\n* A help desk ticket can be as useful as a knowledge base article. There have been many times were I fixed a  problem for a person and the issue came up 6 months later. I've been able to go back and look up how I fixed the problem, helping me get the customer back up and running quickly instead of \\\"re-inventing the wheel\\\" all over again. \\n\\n* A help desk ticket can be used as a learning tool. For example, if you are on the help desk and had to escalate a ticket to another team, as long as the proper resolution was saved you can go back and read it further increasing your knowledge. \\n\\n* A help desk ticket can be used in court. There was a time where a ticket I closed was used in court. Thanks to the documentation in the ticket, I helped save the company I worked for millions of dollars in fines. If the work notes were not there, I may have been fired. \\n\\n* A help desk ticket can help improve your typing and communication skills. Writing good, even lengthy, documentation in a help desk ticket can be cumbersome and frustrating sometimes but the value it adds to your verbal and writing skills is priceless. With better documentation skills you can communicate what you want to say quickly, as well as help you choose proper words and descriptions to use. \\n\\nNow, I know that I have heavily focused on documentation only in help desk tickets, but the same concepts outlined in this article applies to app bug reports (saying \\\"It don't work\\\" is a useless bug report), customer facing articles, and so forth. That is all that I have to say about documentation right now. I hope this convinces you that writing good documentation is important even for help desk tickets and that you will think twice about saying \\\"I don't have the time to document\\\" or \\\"It takes too much of my time to do this\\\". \\n\\n- Joe[the 5 questions](http://www.joedissmeyer.com/2010/09/5-questions-to-ask-every-user-when.html)\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I work in a somewhat large I.T. environment where work and responsibilities are distributed<img src=\"http://www.source-il.com/image/users/59461/ftp/my_files/Work_Order_Icon.png\" alt=\"\"> amongst each team.

There are teams for development, server,\nnetwork, help desk, and so forth. At the time of this writing, I am a member of\nthe network engineering team. Our entire I.T. organization also uses the same\nwork order system or \"ticket system\" for tracking issues, problems, and user\nrequests. In each \"ticket\", we are all expected to make notes and track our work\nespecially adding in our troubleshooting notes and what we did to resolve the\nticket. But there isn't a week that goes by where our team is assigned a ticket\nwhere there is ZERO information to go off of. If you follow my articles on this\nsite, you are already aware that I pretty much expect \"\" to be answered in each\nticket before it is escalated or re-assigned to someone else. I also expect\nthese questions to be answered by myself and yes, I do make mistakes sometimes.\nBut I want to bring up an internal problem that we all face too often in our\nI.T. roles where we completely drop the ball on writing decent documentation.\nSo, what are some examples of poor documentation in a help desk ticket? Here are\na few:\n\n1. The help desk receives a call from a customer\\user about a problem with their\ncomputer where they cannot access the internet. From the activity logs, we see\nthat the ticket remains in the help desk queue for several hours, and is then\nsimply assigned to the Desktop support team to resolve with no troubleshooting\nnotes. Then, a person on the desktop support team takes ownership of the ticket.\nThe ticket sits in their work order queue for a few more hours, then that person\nassigns it to the network team with a note that says something to the effect of\n\"PC can't get online. Please check the wall jack.\" This is where the activity\ntrail ends.\n2. A desktop support team member creates a new ticket for a user because the\nuser is unable to print to a network printer in their department. According to\nthe activity log in the ticket, the desktop support team member noted the error\nthat appears onscreen when trying to print from the user's computer and also has\na screenshot attached to the ticket. The ticket was in the desktop support\nticket queue for one hour, then was escalated to the server team with a note\nasking them to reboot the print server.\n3. An developer on the web applications team opens a ticket for a customer and\nassigns it to desktop support asking them to assist a customer that is having\nissues trying to access the company's website.  There are no further notes and\nno details about the problem the customer is experiencing.\nIn the first scenario, we don't know if this is a widespread issue or if this is\na problem localized to the customer's computer. We also have no idea what\ntroubleshooting was done by the help desk or the desktop support team member.\nThe network team member must now go through troubleshooting 101 all over again\nbecause there was no information on what was done in the ticket.\n\nThe second scenario is similar to the first. The first question that should have\nbeen answered in this ticket is \"Is this a widespread problem, or is only this\nperson having a printing problem?\" Long story short, the problem was local to\nthe desktop (Windows Print Spooler problem) and should have been handled at the\nfront end.\n\nThe third scenario highlights internal communication problems. Sure, there are\ngood reasons why developers shouldn't be contacting a customer directly. But the\ndeveloper needs to help guide the desktop support technician in the right\ndirection so they aren't entirely lost.\n\nBased on the information from the scenarios above, it is clear there is a\nserious breakdown of providing proper documentation. We all are very busy and we\nall do work very hard, but having a lack of documentation hurts everyone. Saying\nthe \"I don't have the time\" excuse isn't an excuse at all - it is a cop out. The\nprimary rule of working in work orders or help desk tickets is this:\n\nIf it isn't in the ticket, it never happened.  Just imagine that you were\nworking on a problem for a customer and you resolved the problem and closed out\nthe ticket without putting in your work notes. If the customer called back to\ncomplain they are still having the same problem, it would appear that you\nliterally didn't do any work. Now imagine that you are working for a company\nthat was being wrongfully sued by a customer due to a ticket you worked on. If\nyou had proper documentation, you would have little to worry about. The second\nrule about documentation in help desk tickets is also very simple:\n\nThe ticket needs to tell a story.  Work notes in a ticket need to be meaningful\nand somewhat easy to understand in case someone else reads your notes\n(especially your manager). Proper notes in help desk tickets is usually proof\nthat you are working hard, as well as learning on the job. What you or your boss\nshould be able to do is open a closed\\resolved ticket and very easily be able to\nread out who did what in that ticket, as well as read the actual resolution of\nthe ticket, almost like it is a story.\n\nLeaving out the resolution in a ticket and just saying \"Fixed\" or \"Done\" doesn't\ncount as a proper resolution to the story.\n\nMake it count.\nSome facts about help desk tickets:\n\n * A help desk ticket can be as useful as a knowledge base article. There have\n   been many times were I fixed a  problem for a person and the issue came up 6\n   months later. I've been able to go back and look up how I fixed the problem,\n   helping me get the customer back up and running quickly instead of\n   \"re-inventing the wheel\" all over again.\n   \n   \n * A help desk ticket can be used as a learning tool. For example, if you are on\n   the help desk and had to escalate a ticket to another team, as long as the\n   proper resolution was saved you can go back and read it further increasing\n   your knowledge.\n   \n   \n * A help desk ticket can be used in court. There was a time where a ticket I\n   closed was used in court. Thanks to the documentation in the ticket, I helped\n   save the company I worked for millions of dollars in fines. If the work notes\n   were not there, I may have been fired.\n   \n   \n * A help desk ticket can help improve your typing and communication skills.\n   Writing good, even lengthy, documentation in a help desk ticket can be\n   cumbersome and frustrating sometimes but the value it adds to your verbal and\n   writing skills is priceless. With better documentation skills you can\n   communicate what you want to say quickly, as well as help you choose proper\n   words and descriptions to use.\n   \n   \n\nNow, I know that I have heavily focused on documentation only in help desk\ntickets, but the same concepts outlined in this article applies to app bug\nreports (saying \"It don't work\" is a useless bug report), customer facing\narticles, and so forth. That is all that I have to say about documentation right\nnow. I hope this convinces you that writing good documentation is important even\nfor help desk tickets and that you will think twice about saying \"I don't have\nthe time to document\" or \"It takes too much of my time to do this\".\n\n * Joethe 5 questions\n   [http://www.joedissmeyer.com/2010/09/5-questions-to-ask-every-user-when.html]","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2013-06-06T22:00:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2013-06-25T15:47:05.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2013-06-06T22:00:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdcc42","uuid":"9520bb34-06a8-4406-84da-3d3664955bcc","title":"I wrote a book!","slug":"i_wrote_a_book-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"This is a very exciting time for me right now.

We have Orion Network Performance Monitor as well as Orion Network [![](http://www.webdesignbooth.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/solarwinds-orion-network-performance-monitor.jpg)](http://www.solarwinds.com)\\n\\nThe problem came up when we deleted a node from Orion NPM two days ago. For some reason, NCM was still trying to perform a config backup job and we received an error this morning about it. I logged into the NCM console and saw that the node was still showing as active. However, opening the Orion NPM web console shows that it was deleted. Why was NCM still trying to run config backups on a node we deleted from NPM two days ago?\\n\\nEven though Orion NPM and Orion NCM share the same Orion Core database (we run both software installs on the same server) and have several components integrated with each other in the Orion website, each product still operate as if they are completely separate from each other still running their own SQL databases. When you delete a node in Orion NPM, the node is not deleted in NCM at the same time. In order to completely delete a device from the entire Orion system, you need to delete it first from Orion NPM, then delete it from Orion NCM. You can manage a device in NCM without monitoring it with, or adding it to, NPM. Likewise, you can monitor device performance in NPM without adding it to, or managing it with, NCM.\\n\\n### Delete a node from Orion NPM\\n\\nDeleting a node will remove all historical data for that device in Orion NPM. This includes all performance data, device details, uptime and downtime information, etc. You cannot undo a node deletion in Orion NPM.

Over the past four years I had uploaded a decent amount of family pictures to my profile, had over 300 people in my friends list, and had spent countless hours posting, re-posting, sharing, typing, and butting into various conversations and dialogue on hundreds (if not thousands) of other Facebook profiles. Most of the people I interacted with on Facebook I personally knew at one point or another either from my own experience or through my family and friends; others I did not. I shared my personal views, offered advice, posted jokes and funny comments, and tons of other things. Some of the things I posted were important, but most were not.\\n\\nFacebook had been a part of my life, as well as my entire family's life, for almost five years. It used to be a great place to share. It was clean, simple, and easy to use. But like our society, Facebook has evolved and transformed into an ugly and vile place – which is something that I think Facebook was never originally intended to be. To me, Facebook was supposed to be a safe place to connect with friends and peers that only you want to allow into your “circle of trust” [gratuitous ‘Meet the Parents’ reference]. But over the years, the circle of trust idea has exploded into something that I can barely explain. I can’t blame Zuck and his dev teams for what has happened to this amazing social system. Facebook members are what makes Facebook the type of experience it is today. Facebook is a free ecosystem - It is only as good as the people that support it which are its members. And a majority of people no longer make it an enjoyable place to spend my time. The reasons of why I closed my account are many, but there are three primary reasons why I closed my account.\\n\\nThe idea of closing my Facebook account came about during the 2012 American political election season. During the debates, the internet was rife with various opinions and ideas, and so was Facebook. I came to expect certain things to be said about each side. But this election cycle’s comments and actions by far seemed to be the most… bold… compared to what I have experienced in the past. I kept fairly quiet during the entire election cycle having only a single comment about the final Presidential Debate in October which, to my delight, did not spark any controversy. I had quietly viewed some of my family and friends’ profiles without leaving comments but decided to stop posting anything. After the elections were over, I rarely logged into my account, but I did update with short and simple comments whenever I logged in. It wasn’t until after the Sandy Hook shootings that I finally decided to close my account.\\n\\nThe main reason why I closed my account is that it is impossible to have an intelligent conversation with anyone on Facebook anymore. You can no longer say simple things like “Praise God!” without someone responding with a comment that says something like “There is no God you idiot. God is for dumb people and you are the epitome of stupidity. Take your God comments and go somewhere else.” You are no longer allowed to agree with a political view such as “Repeal the Obama Healthcare law.” without someone saying very bluntly “You are a racist for not wanting the law. You suck and I hope you die!”. And don’t even bother trying to comment about gun control or abortion, positive or negative. Forget about making comments on someone’s world-view, philosophy, trying to comment on truth, fact or fiction, or anything meaningful for that matter. Facebook is now a rant-fest and it is incredibly depressing. It has become a rally point for those looking for some type of acceptance. Most of these people will say and do anything to get attention, or to get someone to follow and\\\\or agree to their point of view.\\n\\nRespect or etiquette on Facebook has long been stripped from most contributor comments. I have found that the uneducated and uninformed let their true colors come out on Facebook more than anyone else. In their mind no one is entitled to an opinion because “I am right and you are wrong and that’s the way it is.” Dissention is not allowed and debating a viewpoint is no longer welcome. I believe that this has to do with the way our society now behaves in general which has trickled down into the social networks (or have come from the social networks for that matter). Social networks have empowered people to say and do what they want, how they want, whenever they want, and to whomever they want to say it to without the fear of any consequences. Because “hey, this is the internet right? And the internet is freedom of speech right?”… People have come to believe that they no longer have to account for their own actions, beliefs, or comments anymore – especially on social networks. This is drama that I simply do not need to be a part of, nor support.\\n\\nThe last reason of why I closed my Facebook account is this realization about “social networks” in general. We are becoming a society of disconnectedness. Somehow we have come to believe that having a smartphone, watching CNN or FoxNews on cable TV, having multiple email accounts, tweeting the latest news, having the largest amount of ‘friends’ on social networks, and knowing the latest and greatest up-to-date information from social networks makes us more connected than ever. But it is a lie. The more you focus on keeping your social network status up to date the more you will become personally disconnected from your family and peers and, in effect, forces your mind to become shut off from the world. This is what leads to depression, addiction, and loneliness. Do you now see what _information overload_ does? Don’t take my word for it, [look up the various articles and studies yourself](http://www.google.com/#q=effects+of+facebook)\\n\\nSo what now?\\n\\nI don’t see opinionated comments anymore, unsettling pictures, or people trolling through some of my old posts and revisiting things (stuff from the past) that I don’t need to talk about anymore.

Take your God comments and go somewhere else.” You\nare no longer allowed to agree with a political view such as “Repeal the Obama\nHealthcare law.” without someone saying very bluntly “You are a racist for not\nwanting the law. You suck and I hope you die!”. And don’t even bother trying to\ncomment about gun control or abortion, positive or negative. Forget about making\ncomments on someone’s world-view, philosophy, trying to comment on truth, fact\nor fiction, or anything meaningful for that matter. Facebook is now a rant-fest\nand it is incredibly depressing. It has become a rally point for those looking\nfor some type of acceptance. Most of these people will say and do anything to\nget attention, or to get someone to follow and\\or agree to their point of view.\n\nRespect or etiquette on Facebook has long been stripped from most contributor\ncomments. I have found that the uneducated and uninformed let their true colors\ncome out on Facebook more than anyone else. In their mind no one is entitled to\nan opinion because “I am right and you are wrong and that’s the way it is.”\nDissention is not allowed and debating a viewpoint is no longer welcome. I\nbelieve that this has to do with the way our society now behaves in general\nwhich has trickled down into the social networks (or have come from the social\nnetworks for that matter). Social networks have empowered people to say and do\nwhat they want, how they want, whenever they want, and to whomever they want to\nsay it to without the fear of any consequences. Because “hey, this is the\ninternet right? And the internet is freedom of speech right?”… People have come\nto believe that they no longer have to account for their own actions, beliefs,\nor comments anymore – especially on social networks. This is drama that I simply\ndo not need to be a part of, nor support.\n\nThe last reason of why I closed my Facebook account is this realization about\n“social networks” in general. We are becoming a society of disconnectedness.\nSomehow we have come to believe that having a smartphone, watching CNN or\nFoxNews on cable TV, having multiple email accounts, tweeting the latest news,\nhaving the largest amount of ‘friends’ on social networks, and knowing the\nlatest and greatest up-to-date information from social networks makes us more\nconnected than ever. But it is a lie. The more you focus on keeping your social\nnetwork status up to date the more you will become personally disconnected from\nyour family and peers and, in effect, forces your mind to become shut off from\nthe world. This is what leads to depression, addiction, and loneliness. Do you\nnow see what information overload  does? Don’t take my word for it, look up the\nvarious articles and studies yourself\n[http://www.google.com/#q=effects+of+facebook]\n\nSo what now?\n\nI don’t see opinionated comments anymore, unsettling pictures, or people\ntrolling through some of my old posts and revisiting things (stuff from the\npast) that I don’t need to talk about anymore. After closing my Facebook\naccount, I can say that I am a happier man. I am spending more time with my\nfamily and I am actually having more face to face conversations. I am on the\nphone talking with my parents and friends instead of typing quick little\ncomments on their Facebook Wall\\Timeline. I don’t worry any more about what\nsomeone may have said, or might say. And you know what? I don’t miss Facebook.\nNot one bit.\n\nFacebook is the first social network that I have completely severed my ties\nwith. If my Twitter profile ever gets to the extreme like I had with Facebook, I\nwill probably abandon that as well, and then Google+ if that gets out of hand,\nand then LinkedIn, and so on. I do wish Facebook and everyone on the social\nnetwork well. But I have chosen to no longer be victim to the drama that plagues\nFacebook Timelines…\n\nNow, this is only my opinion and may be more of a problem with our society in\ngeneral. But nonetheless, Facebook members are composed of the people in our\nsociety. In effect, our society makes Facebook what it is.\n\n * Joe","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2013-01-15T05:53:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2013-01-15T05:53:43.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2013-01-15T05:53:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdcc48","uuid":"b7a0066f-1191-4d71-84f3-cfc10f154a82","title":"The Friendship Algorithm, in Microsoft Visio","slug":"the_friendship_algorithm_in_microsoft_visio-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"[![The Friendship Algorithm](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-xReL4rkskNM/UNIzX6BbVDI/AAAAAAAABuE/uhn9dRjHkWY/The%252520Friendship%252520Algorithm_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"The Friendship Algorithm\\\")](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-w2ai0_F0eP4/UNIzXS7IaaI/AAAAAAAABt8/jK3YL7_gb5I/s1600-h/The%252520Friendship%252520Algorithm%25255B3%25255D.png)\\n\\nThis is a short post for today, and a good time waster.

This is another article that would go along with my \\\"advanced windows desktop troubleshooting\\\" series of posts only if I actually did have such a series on this site.![](http://www.techvilleonline.com/slow-computer.jpg) Maybe I should set up an article series here in the future? Anyways, on with the article!\\n\\nIf you have been following my recent articles then you know that recently I had the opportunity to work with my colleagues in attempting to resolve an issue regarding slow boot performance in Windows 7\\\\. [We did find at least one major problem](http://www.joedissmeyer.com/2012/10/advanced-windows-desktop.html)\\n\\nThe boot performance issues were on computers in public areas. Each public computer has a very large Windows 7 \\\"image\\\" deployed to it (around 100gb) that has a great deal of embedded software which includes Faronics DeepFreeze to prevent any type of system changes. Each of these computers are used by our customers every single day. From cold boot to CTRL+ALT+DEL the PC would take around 2 minutes then from the login screen to a fully usable desktop it would take at least 5 to 6 minutes. Adding these numbers up means that it would literally take around 8 minutes for a user to log into a computer and be able to actually use it to do work. You can imagine how angry our customers felt having to wait around 10 minutes just to use a computer! \\n\\nFirst we need to ask the question, \\\"What exactly is an acceptable amount of time it should take for a user to log in to a computer and work?\\\" 8 minutes is not acceptable by any imagination. To get straight to the point and without getting into a philosophical discussion, between 2 - 4 minutes is a very acceptable boot time for a computer regardless of the type of hardware it has in it. \\n\\nIn order to troubleshoot this issue and fix the problem, we used several Sysinternals tools (Process Monitor and Autoruns) to see what was going launching at startup and to view what processes were running during boot and winlogon. But the final tool that helped to resolve our issue was the metrics in the Windows Performance Toolkit.\\n\\nThe Windows Performance Toolkit is a part of the or, Windows Assessment and Deployment Toolkit. [ADK](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30652)\\n\\nTo start troubleshooting, we set up a test computer with the large Windows 7 image deployed to it. We disabled DeepFreeze then installed the Windows Performance Toolkit on it. The toolkit includes two specific tools, the Windows Performance Recorder and the Windows Performance Analyzer. Using the recorder, we set the following options: \\n\\n* Resource Analysis = CPU Usage and Disk I/O Activity only\\n* Performance Scenario = Boot\\n* Number of Iterations = 1\\n\\n[![image](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-KpQvWJNQ1Bk/UKRsYNgWNcI/AAAAAAAABhk/1YpPcqFJ5o4/image_thumb%25255B2%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-6pR_x7ZgkGM/UKRsXZLobDI/AAAAAAAABhc/hm2HgtH3CKQ/s1600-h/image%25255B4%25255D.png)\\n\\nAfter clicking Start, the PC rebooted. We logged back in (after it took 8 minutes to build the user profile) and launched the Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) app again which prompted us to save the boot trace log. The log was saved as an .ETL file in C:\\\\users\\\\%username%\\\\WPR Files\\\\, so now we could use the Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) on any other computer with the Windows Performance Toolkit installed to view the data.\\n\\nOpening the boot trace with WPA immediately displayed some _very_ interesting results. Take a look at the screenshot below.\\n\\n[![image](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Ggdo_5JYTZQ/UKRsZaPk8bI/AAAAAAAABh0/eWzUOBSaThg/image_thumb%25255B11%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-H7idIndkwpI/UKRsYgrH_3I/AAAAAAAABhs/pKwsu03URTM/s1600-h/image%25255B21%25255D.png)\\n\\nRight under the graph explorer pane immediately displayed the problem. **<font color=\\\"#ff0000\\\">High disk I/O</font>**. The hard drive in the computer is literally pegged for the entire first 5 & 1\\\\2 minutes of the boot and logon process. This brings us to lesson number one in troubleshooting boot performance issues = **<u>High disk I/O is the number one culprit of poor boot performance</u>**. So now we have an idea of why the computer is taking so long to log in a user. But we still didn’t know exactly what the culprits were.\\n\\nUsing the data graphs in the Windows Performance Analyzer, we broke down the data even further. We knew exactly how long this boot trace took (430 seconds or 7.1 minutes) and exactly how long each boot phase was taking to complete. If you look at the display below, you can see that it was taking at least 185 seconds to build a user profile, and an additional 91 seconds to finish post-boot actions.

Each of these computers are used by our customers every single day. From cold boot to CTRL+ALT+DEL the PC would take around 2 minutes then from the login screen to a fully usable desktop it would take at least 5 to 6 minutes.

To get straight to the point and without getting into a philosophical discussion, between 2 - 4 minutes is a very acceptable boot time for a computer regardless of the type of hardware it has in it.</p>\n<p>In order to troubleshoot this issue and fix the problem, we used several Sysinternals tools (Process Monitor and Autoruns) to see what was going launching at startup and to view what processes were running during boot and winlogon.

We use two different Windows deployment types depending on where the ![](http://yaprocmon.sourceforge.net/Images/icon.png)computer is going. There is one very large specialty “image” (100gb in size) and one smaller “image” (15gb) for the general staff. The large image has a great deal of large software installs embedded in the image, while the smaller image is a standard one that include Microsoft Office, Adobe Reader, and other similar core apps that one may need. One special note about the larger deployment type is that it has Faronics DeepFreeze installed on it to prevent system changes. \\nWhen these computers started getting deployed on our network, a strange issue was happening. When a user would log in with their domain credentials on a PC with the 100GB image, it would literally take anywhere from 7-15 minutes for the desktop to go from logon screen to desktop view. We knew that the computer was not frozen at the “Welcome” screen after logging in because the please wait circle icon was rotating. All the user had to do was sit and wait around 10 minutes (or longer) until the computer displayed the desktop. This issue did not occur on computers with the standard deployment image. \\n\\nIn the beginning (when this issue really started), I pretty much knew where to start looking to resolve the problem. I remembered a TechEd 2010 video called \\\"\\\" by Mark Russinovich, and I remembered reading some of his . I emailed some of this information to the support personnel to inform them that since no one could find the root cause, I recommended to take a look at Mark's blog posts for guidance. A few weeks went by and I never heard anything about it. But after a short while, the issue exploded and the “blame game” started up. One person would claim, “The network is the problem!”, or “The servers are the problem!”, or “The deployment image is the problem!”. Some people started clamoring, “Give me back my old Windows XP computer. I didn’t have a problem until I got this Windows 7 PC!”. We’ve all heard that one at some point in time haven’t we? (cough, Vista)… Anywhoo, lets move on. \\n\\nNow, this issue had been going on for a few months but it wasn't a big deal until now. Some of the company \\\"higher-ups\\\" contacted our I.T.

In the beginning it made sense to bring in all of these people resources because more and more Windows 7 computers were being deployed and this was now a widespread issue. \\n\\nEach team (Desktop support, Server, Network, Security) worked together trying to locate the root cause.

To our surprise, the Wireshark captures and Windows Event viewer showed nothing strange. The image settings were the same as the smaller image and the problem came back even after rebuilding the large image. There were no viruses or worms detected. Did we disable IPv6? You bet we did. Did that fix the problem? Nope. In the end, the problem largely eluded us. \\n\\nI was working on another critical project at the time research of this problem began. Since others were already putting in time on the problem, I stayed on the sidelines. But it was “all hands on deck” to resolve this issue and everyone was looking for help to get this problem fixed. Before long, my supervisor asked me to take a quick look at the problem since I may be able to help. I took a step back and looked at exactly what was going on. In general, the problem was very common. For some reason the computer was taking forever to finish the logon process. After a user logs into the computer using their domain credentials the \\\"Welcome\\\" screen would display with the rotating circle and stay in that mode for 5 to 10 minutes before the desktop would finally display. Using Mark's blog post \\\"\\\" as a guide, I turned to Process Monitor to start troubleshooting the problem. After I logged into on of the affected PCs, I copied PROCMON to the desktop of the PC, ran it, and enabled the boot logging option. \\n\\nI wanted to capture all processes and events both during boot and after logging in, so I checked the box to generate profiling events every second. \\n\\nAfter choosing this option, I immediately rebooted the computer. I logged back in (waiting the 5-10 minutes for the desktop to display), then launched Process Monitor and chose to save the boot logs immediately to the desktop. To my surprise, the boot logs were spread over four files and totaled over 1.3GB in size! Double-clicking on one of them opened up the entire log and displayed over 3 million events. \\n\\nI needed a starting point. For that, I used Mark's blog as a reference. I cut straight to the chase and opened the Process Tree by clicking <u>Options >> Process Tree</u>. \\n\\nThe Process Tree shows every process that ran, was running, or opened at some point, during a logged trace. Starting from the bottom of the list I started looking at WinLogon.exe. The only thing that really stood out was the Citrix Receiver application. This entire process monitor trace starts at 3:57pm and ends at 4:05pm. The Citrix Receiver app started at 3:59 and ended at 4:02, taking 3 minutes to execute. \\n\\nAnother clue was the dark green bar under the Life Time column. Dark green indicates how long the process took to complete within this boot trace timeline. Anything light green indicates that the process never stopped during the trace (which is usually an internal Windows process or service). However, I was very skeptical that this was the culprit because looking at the sub-processes the Receiver app itself launches and runs in the system tray at all times. Plus, I hadn't heard of the Citrix Receiver causing boot problems before. So from the bottom of the Process Tree working my way up, I started looking at all of the processes one-by-one. Half-way up the list four very distinct dark green bars which were stacked on top of each other, in order, immediately caught my attention. \\n\\nTwo WScript processes were running side-by-side. But one of them called an application called FRAMEPKG.EXE. WScript is the Windows Script Host process that runs the domain VBscript login scripts on this computer. Yes, this computer is a member of a domain and in this domain we run login scripts. After one of the WScript process started, it launched FRAMEPKG.EXE, and under that executed FRMINST.EXE, which invokes Windows Installer (MSIEXEC.EXE). Framepkg.exe is digitally signed by McAfee as shown in the display grid. After doing a web search, I found that it is a part of the McAfee Antivirus Enterprise product.

But for others, it may be a challenge. One\nway or another, locating evidence that leads to the solution starts where the\nissue was found. It is up to you to find it. Troubleshooting the Windows desktop\nis like crime scene investigations and forensics; If you dig deep enough, you\nwill find the culprit.\n\nThere isn't much more to say here in this article other than to praise Mark\nRussinovich and Bryce Cogswell, as well as their Sysinternals colleagues, for\ncreating these tools because without them I guarantee that we would still be\nworking on trying to resolve the issue, or contacting Microsoft support\nservices. This is only but one example of why it is important to use the correct\ntools to troubleshoot a problem. I will close out this article with the\nfollowing quote from Mark Russinovich himself...\n\n\"When you take the approach of restart the app or restart the operating system\nor even re-install an operating system and start from scratch and hope that the\nproblem doesn't happen again, you haven't learned anything, you don't know what\ncaused the problem, you don't know how severe the problem is, or if the problem\nis going to come back and bite you again. It is worth spending even just a few\nminutes to go try to figure out what's happened. Often times, that will lead you\nto a solution.\" - Mark Russinovich, TechEd 2010 Session \"\"\n\nThe Case of the Unexplained, 2010: Troubleshooting with Mark Russinovich\n[http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2010/WCL315]","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2012-10-13T03:45:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2012-10-17T15:54:40.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2012-10-13T03:45:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdcc50","uuid":"fdba32a7-0775-4a5d-bcba-28864fa507b4","title":"RightFax 9.4 error, “The fax server could not find an account matching your network login”","slug":"right_fax_9_4_error_the_fax_server_could_not_find_an_account_matching_your_network_login-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Here is the scenario: You just finished installing RightFax on a Windows Server and launch the RightFax Enterprise Fax Manager tool from the Start Menu.

There are several differences with this design compared to the last one: \\n\\n* The SOHO home WiFi router will be removed entirely. NAT will be handled on Router-Core-V1\\\\. DHCP and DNS will operate on my Domain Controller, which is also a virtual machine.\\n* Eth0 on Router-Core-V1 is hard-linked to ESXi NIC #1, which is then directly connected to the ISP modem. Thanks to NAT on the Vyatta router, I can create as many private networks as I want without worrying about the traffic reaching the internet if I have the need.\\n\\nNow, it is important to note here that it is possible to build the exact same type of virtual playground with Hyper-V, Citrix XenServer, Xen, and other virtualization hypervisors. Why did I choose VMware for this exercise? Because of a special project that I am not yet privy to discussing publicly! \\n\\nSo this is pretty much it. I didn’t really elaborate on the design, but you can make out the detailed configs from the diagrams above. There are many different ways to mimic an enterprise network using virtualization tech. \\n\\n-Joe \\n\\n<iframe bordercolor=\\\"#000000\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"250\\\" hspace=\\\"0\\\" marginheight=\\\"0\\\" marginwidth=\\\"0\\\" scrolling=\\\"no\\\" src=\\\"http://ad.doubleclick.net/adi/N7433.148119.BLOGGEREN/B6675536.642;sz=300x250;ord=[timestamp]?;lid=41000000028007181;pid=UBM9780321832214;usg=AFHzDLvTyJP_PIzyst2ZiQysTQ1R1B4ldg;adurl=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.cdsbooksdvds.com%252Fproduct.jhtm%253Fsku%253DUBM9780321832214;pubid=585830;price=%2446.43;title=Vmware+Vsphere+5+By+Maille%2C+Eric%2F+Mennecier%2C+Rene-francois;merc=CDS+Books+and+DVDS;imgsrc=http%3A%2F%2Fc376013.r13.cf1.rackcdn.com%2F9780321832214.jpg;width=103;height=135\\\" vspace=\\\"0\\\" width=\\\"300\\\"></iframe>\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Virtualization and software-based networking has opened up a world of possibilities not only in designing and consolidating enterprise infrastructure, but also for personal training.  I like to verify my current knowledge and and trying out new technology all the time.

However, it is usually difficult to do\nthis because in order to do networking training you usually need vast amounts of\nhardware. Thanks to virtualization, I can ramp up as many servers as the\nvirtualization host can handle, set up a bunch of virtual switches and routers,\nand assign whatever I want to the physical NICs on the virtual host.\n\nOne of the things that I enjoy doing the most in my “free time” is building my\nown test labs and test networks. I have had a great deal of success doing this\nusing various virtualization and software-based networking technologies. At the\nmoment, I have one VMware ESXi 5.1 host with two virtual routers running Vyatta\nNetwork OS 6.4. So far the installation is rock solid and I haven’t had any\nissues aside from the NATting, which I will address in a minute…\n\nThe screenshot below is a visual representation of my current network\nenvironment at home.\n[http://lh4.ggpht.com/-WiifYifVl7Q/UGc-PP4YeOI/AAAAAAAABbg/abh7wPUASWs/s1600-h/Vyatta-design3.png]\nFrom this diagram, you should be able to tell that all I did was connect my ESXi\nhost to the simple switch. This was OK for a time, but my needs have expanded\nfrom this simple setup. The problem lies with the SOHO home WiFi router. Most of\nthe SOHO routers will only NAT for a single subnet and nothing else. Because I\nhave a 2nd router with multiple subnets, only the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet is able\nto reach the internet. The good news is that all of my private subnets can\n‘talk’ to each other thanks to static routes on the Vyatta routers, but only the\none subnet is actually able to reach the internet. I need to make a change.\nBelow is a Visio of my long term implementation plan.\n[http://lh3.ggpht.com/-j2XFF-BVOag/UGc-QcPCOvI/AAAAAAAABbw/qJWFdMJQw_Q/s1600-h/Vyatta%252520design%252520-%252520long%252520term%252520plan%25255B7%25255D.png]\nIn this updated design, even though I didn’t need to I chose to stick with using\ntwo Vyatta routers, I did so anyways (more of a challenge in my opinion).

One file is the GPL Ghostscript writer, the other file is the actual CutePDF app.  So you need to install the Ghostscript writer first, then install CutePDF. The Ghostscript install is very fast and is almost silent. The CutePDF Writer installation is a straightforward one; click next to start, accept the license agreement, then click Install. In the past, the Ask Toolbar was bundled with the installer. But in today’s download it appears to have been removed, which is a good thing! After the installation finished, a web page pops up to a small readme about the software.\\n\\nUsing CutePDF is simple. Just print a document and choose the CutePDF Writer printer. The screenshot is from Microsoft Word 2010.\\n\\n[![image](http://lh5.ggpht.com/-XuS7rlNrQM4/UGIHPzLX6xI/AAAAAAAABZw/C_i88y_H2i4/image_thumb%25255B12%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-5LOa5lJEASM/UGIHPT6_rhI/AAAAAAAABZo/o1HIpjA9EPQ/s1600-h/image%25255B20%25255D.png)\\n\\nAfter printing the document, a small classic Windows 98 style “Save As” window appears. Choose a folder location to store the file and click Save to finish. All in all, this is a pretty straght-forward process.\\n\\nSo that is pretty much it for CutePDF Writer. There isn’t much to it, which is why it is loved by so many! It is simple to use and doesn’t eat up system resources.\\n\\n**<font color=\\\"#f79646\\\" size=\\\"3\\\">FreePDF Creator Impressions:</font>**\\n\\nFreePDF Creator installer has a file size of 11.8mb and is a single file download, already making it easier to install for non-technical users.\\n\\nThe FreePDF Creator installation process is fairly straightforward. Run the installer, click next, accept the license agreement, then you hit a registration page. The registration page is somewhat misleading because it appears that you must register in order to use it, but in fact there is a skip button at the bottom. I skipped the registration for this installation.\\n\\n[![image](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-eVU0Gnun0zM/UGIHRA8XWjI/AAAAAAAABaA/l-84A8mb25s/image_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](http://lh3.ggpht.com/-kopNJ_7eIc8/UGIHQoa-FdI/AAAAAAAABZ4/QyJzs1uhfL4/s1600-h/image%25255B3%25255D.png)\\n\\nAfter clicking install, the installer kicked off a few Visual C++ runtime installations and to my surprise it installed the same GPL Ghostwriter driver that CutePDF Writer uses. This explains the reason why the installer is a bit larger than CutePDF.\\n\\nCreating a PDF with FreePDF Creator is the same process as in CutePDF. Print a document and choose the FreePDF printer from the drop down list. The screenshot below shows an example from Microsoft Word 2010.\\n\\n[![image](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-4pEBgs65J9Q/UGIHSRF-2MI/AAAAAAAABaQ/aeCORXn0z40/image_thumb%25255B8%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-SBMxiZKd16g/UGIHR2GUzqI/AAAAAAAABaE/_-wkBj4wRn0/s1600-h/image%25255B14%25255D.png)\\n\\nThe FreePDF Creator app appears and presents you with several options.\\n\\n[![image](http://lh4.ggpht.com/-UNoYG3F6Y9Y/UGIHT2a2DbI/AAAAAAAABag/DwuKoS_2t0w/image_thumb%25255B10%25255D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](http://lh6.ggpht.com/-A5Agj4GfQDc/UGIHTIQbxLI/AAAAAAAABaY/9iOGU7aVRN0/s1600-h/image%25255B16%25255D.png)\\n\\nIt is here where FreePDF Creator outshines CutePDF Writer. There are three different settings you can change when creating a PDF with FreePDF Creator; Output Quality, Document Properties, and Security. The fourth option, PDF Editing options, involves advanced settings for PDF creation that is only included in the commercial version of PDF Converter Pro. The default selections are more than sufficient for creating a simple PDF file. Simply choose a save as location, decide if you want to do after the PDF is created (from the Post Process option), then click Create PDF. The memory footprint for FreePDF Creator is about 20mb including the print driver. This isn’t bad considering that CutePDF uses around the same amount of RAM.\\n\\nSo there are already several things that make FreePDF Creator stand out. But is it a better choice, especially for those that like CutePDF so very much?\\n\\n**<font color=\\\"#f79646\\\" size=\\\"3\\\">The Verdict?</font>**\\n\\nWe are now at the verdict. So, which one wins the shootout? Is it the feature-rich FreePDF Creator, or the traditional and simple CutePDF Writer? First, you need to know that the reality here is that both PDF solutions actually do the _exact same thing_. One way or another, they will create your PDF files and both of them won’t bother you with ads, malware, or ask you to upgrade to their premium versions. In short, they are non-obtrusive and they _just work_. Both software will create monochrome and color PDFs, and each operate in the same manner using a Windows print driver.\\n\\nI have been a user of CutePDF Writer for years but I think I have officially made the switch to FreePDF Creator. Compared to CutePDF, FreePDF Creator has built in security features and document editing options that you would normally have to pay extra for. I would actually use these security features because I do email out Microsoft Powerpoint presentations in PDF format on occasion and with FreePDF Creator I can now secure them. In my opinion, FreePDF Creator it was easier to install than CutePDF Writer and the FreePDF website is easier to navigate.\\n\\nIn the end, if you are looking for absolute simplicity and the smallest system footprint then is what you should go for. But if you want a solution that is easy to install, has document security features, and has document quality settings then you would be more interested in [FreePDF Creator](http://www.pdfconverter.com/freepdfcreator/)\\n\\n- Joe\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Normally, I do not “do” product reviews for software companies if they ask me to.

So I figure why not write one of my own articles? This post is all about one specific problem my colleagues and I had with VLAN tagging on an MX80 and MS22 switch. Thanks to help from Meraki customer support, everything is back up and running as expected. \\n\\nWe are using a single MX80 router that has two VLANs configured, VLAN10 with subnet 192.168.10.0/24 and VLAN20 with subnet 192.168.20.0/24\\\\. All untagged traffic was assumed to be on VLAN20\\\\. This means if the network traffic is not tagged on the switch, then the router will move the traffic to VLAN20\\\\. DHCP is running on the MX80 and is configured to dish out IP addresses to each subnet accordingly. Connected to the MX80 router is one MS22 switch, with one trunk port allowing all VLANs. The first half of the ports on the MS22 switch is tagging traffic for VLAN10 with the second half of the switch ports tagging for VLAN20. \\n\\nFor some reason, when connecting a host to the VLAN10 switch ports, the MX80 was ignoring the VLAN tagging and assigning an DHCP address to the host from the VLAN20 scope - breaking our security model for this network. Any traffic tagged on VLAN10 should be assigned a DHCP IP address on the VLAN10 subnet correct? Well, not exactly. The problem was due to two things: \\n1) The MX80 was configured to put untagged traffic on VLAN20. \\n2) The Management VLAN on the MS22 was still set for VLAN 1. \\n\\nIn order to fix this, the solution was simple - change the management VLAN on the MS22 to VLAN 20. \\nA more secure option was to configure the following: \\n\\n1. Configure a static IP address on the MS22 switch. (This must be the first step!)\\n2. Configure the Management VLAN on the MS22 switch to VLAN 1.\\n3. Configure an Uplink port on the MS22 switch as a trunk port, and set it for native VLAN 1.\\n4. Administratively deactivate the unused ports on the MS22 switch.\\n5. Configure the MX80 to drop untagged traffic.\\n\\nWith this network model, all untagged traffic will be dropped. So if some yahoo decides to connect an Ethernet cable directly to an unused port on the switch, the traffic would be dropped instead of being allowed network access via VLAN 20. \\nHere are a few things that I have learned with this type of setup: \\n\\n* Configure the MS22 switch’s static IP address FIRST before you do ANYTHING ELSE. Not configuring the static IP before setting the option on the MX80 to drop untagged traffic will cause the switch to never be able to check into the Meraki Cloud Controller (MCC \\\\ the Dashboard).\\n* If you didn’t set the static IP first, then here is what you need to do to fix the problem:\\n\\n* On the MX80, change the setting for Untagged traffic to VLAN10.\\n* Wait 2-3 minutes, then check the dashboard to see if the switch has checked in. If not, fully reset the MS22 switch from the Reset button on the front panel.\\n* Verify that the switch has now checked into MCC.\\n* Assign the static IP address from the dashboard under Monitor >> Switches >> Choose the switch, under status click SET IP ADDRESS.\\n\\nAfter making the VLAN changes on the MX80 and after resetting the MS switch, note the LAN IP and its current DHCP assigned address. If you try to assign a static IP address on a DIFFERENT subnet from what DHCP has assigned the switch, the static assignment will fail (basically, the dashboard acts as if nothing has happened). Meaning if the switch is assigned an IP address of 10.10.10.10 from DHCP, and you try to assign a static IP address of 10.50.50.50, the assignment will fail. You need to make sure the switch is getting a DHCP address from the same subnet that you want to assign a static address. This is why you need to pay attention to the MX80 untagged traffic setting. \\n\\nSo, that is pretty much it. This issue may have been an elementary one, but it all goes back to how VLAN tagging works. I enjoy working with Meraki devices and I have a good feeling that Meraki will continue making more interesting products.

So I figure why not write one of my own\narticles? This post is all about one specific problem my colleagues and I had\nwith VLAN tagging on an MX80 and MS22 switch. Thanks to help from Meraki\ncustomer support, everything is back up and running as expected.\n\nWe are using a single MX80 router that has two VLANs configured, VLAN10 with\nsubnet 192.168.10.0/24 and VLAN20 with subnet 192.168.20.0/24. All untagged\ntraffic was assumed to be on VLAN20. This means if the network traffic is not\ntagged on the switch, then the router will move the traffic to VLAN20. DHCP is\nrunning on the MX80 and is configured to dish out IP addresses to each subnet\naccordingly. Connected to the MX80 router is one MS22 switch, with one trunk\nport allowing all VLANs. The first half of the ports on the MS22 switch is\ntagging traffic for VLAN10 with the second half of the switch ports tagging for\nVLAN20.\n\nFor some reason, when connecting a host to the VLAN10 switch ports, the MX80 was\nignoring the VLAN tagging and assigning an DHCP address to the host from the\nVLAN20 scope - breaking our security model for this network. Any traffic tagged\non VLAN10 should be assigned a DHCP IP address on the VLAN10 subnet correct?\nWell, not exactly. The problem was due to two things:\n\n 1. The MX80 was configured to put untagged traffic on VLAN20.\n 2. The Management VLAN on the MS22 was still set for VLAN 1.\n\nIn order to fix this, the solution was simple - change the management VLAN on\nthe MS22 to VLAN 20.\nA more secure option was to configure the following:\n\n 1. Configure a static IP address on the MS22 switch. (This must be the first\n    step!)\n 2. Configure the Management VLAN on the MS22 switch to VLAN 1.\n 3. Configure an Uplink port on the MS22 switch as a trunk port, and set it for\n    native VLAN 1.\n 4. Administratively deactivate the unused ports on the MS22 switch.\n 5. Configure the MX80 to drop untagged traffic.\n\nWith this network model, all untagged traffic will be dropped. So if some yahoo\ndecides to connect an Ethernet cable directly to an unused port on the switch,\nthe traffic would be dropped instead of being allowed network access via VLAN\n20.\nHere are a few things that I have learned with this type of setup:\n\n * Configure the MS22 switch’s static IP address FIRST before you do ANYTHING\n   ELSE. Not configuring the static IP before setting the option on the MX80 to\n   drop untagged traffic will cause the switch to never be able to check into\n   the Meraki Cloud Controller (MCC \\ the Dashboard).\n   \n   \n * If you didn’t set the static IP first, then here is what you need to do to\n   fix the problem:\n   \n   \n * On the MX80, change the setting for Untagged traffic to VLAN10.\n   \n   \n * Wait 2-3 minutes, then check the dashboard to see if the switch has checked\n   in. If not, fully reset the MS22 switch from the Reset button on the front\n   panel.\n   \n   \n * Verify that the switch has now checked into MCC.\n   \n   \n * Assign the static IP address from the dashboard under Monitor >> Switches >>\n   Choose the switch, under status click SET IP ADDRESS.\n   \n   \n\nAfter making the VLAN changes on the MX80 and after resetting the MS switch,\nnote the LAN IP and its current DHCP assigned address. If you try to assign a\nstatic IP address on a DIFFERENT subnet from what DHCP has assigned the switch,\nthe static assignment will fail (basically, the dashboard acts as if nothing has\nhappened). Meaning if the switch is assigned an IP address of 10.10.10.10 from\nDHCP, and you try to assign a static IP address of 10.50.50.50, the assignment\nwill fail. You need to make sure the switch is getting a DHCP address from the\nsame subnet that you want to assign a static address. This is why you need to\npay attention to the MX80 untagged traffic setting.\n\nSo, that is pretty much it. This issue may have been an elementary one, but it\nall goes back to how VLAN tagging works.

F5 assumes that you are already familiar with various SSL certificate types, the certificate issue process, and how to convert certificates to different formats. Now to be fair, if you are going to be administering an F5 you should already know this information. But since I wasn't well versed in SSL certificates before I started getting acquainted with a BIG-IP appliance, I am going to address those issues here.\\n\\n_**Understanding SSL Certificates**_\\n\\nAn SSL certificate is actually two pieces, a certificate and its private key. When an SSL certificate is 'digitally signed', this means that the private key and the cert itself are paired together. When you need an SSL certificate, you first create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and upload it to a Certificate Authority (CA) such as Verisign or GoDaddy. After you pay the CA to authorize the request, the CA then digitally signs the request with a private key and sends it back to you. This certificate can then be converted to different file formats depending on your needs, and/or directly imported to your server(s) or network appliance(s). SSL Certificates are purchased in 1, 2, or 3 year increments.\\n\\nF5 supports _Self-Signed_ SSL certificates as well as _Root Certificates_. The only difference between the two is that self-signed certificates are generated by, well, you. Root certificates are authorized by a high-level entity which, in essence, are more secure. One reason why you pay a high-level entity like Verisign for an SSL certificate is for the privilege of claiming that your website has been 'verified' to be secure. There are many more reasons why you would want to do this, but know that both cert types encrypt IP traffic between hosts and servers.\\n\\nThere are several certificate file types that you need to be aware of regarding F5 appliances:\\n\\n* PKCS#12 - This is a certificate with a .pfx extension. The certificate and private key are in the same file, but importing the certificate requires a password. The password would have been provided to you from the certificate authority (CA), or certificate issuer such as Verisign.\\n* PKCS#7  - This is a certificate chain with both the cert and the private key embedded and encrypted inside. This file has a .p7b extension. Since the cert key is already embedded and encrypted in the cert file, typing a password to activate the certificate is not required.\\n* PEM (X.509) - Importing an SSL certificate requires that certificate to be in .PEM or X.509 format. This is especially true for F5 devices. However, PKCS#12 certificates in PEM format need to be split into CRT and KEY files. PKCS#7 certificates in PEM format do not require the file to be split.\\n* CRT - The certificate portion of a PKCS#12 PEM file.\\n* KEY - The private key portion of a PKCS#12 PEM file.\\n\\n**_Converting SSL Certificates for F5 BIG-IP Appliances_**\\n\\nYou use F5's TMSH tool to convert SSL certificates. TMSH is accessed simply by connecting to the F5 appliance via SSH using an account with administrative access, then executing \\\"TMSH\\\" at the command line. First, upload the certificate file to the F5's file system, then navigate to the location of it in the file system. If the certificate is an PKCS#12 certificate, then execute the following command:\\n\\n<font face=\\\"Consolas\\\">openssl pkcs12 -in <PKCSfile> -out <filename>.pem -nodes</font>\\n\\nIf the certificate is an PKCS#7 certificate, execute this command instead:\\n\\n<font face=\\\"Consolas\\\">openssl pkcs7 -in <PKCSfile>.p7b -text -out <filename>.pem -print_certs</font>\\n\\nAfter conversion, copy the newly created PEM file to your desktop. You can move on to the next section if you have a PKCS#7 cert. If you have a PKCS#12 PEM file you need to split it by performing the following steps:\\n\\n1. Open the PEM file with a text editor.\\n2. Copy/paste the BEGIN CERTIFICATE area into a new text file. Name the TXT file and change it's file extension to .CRT.\\n3. Copy/paste the BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY area into a new text file. Name this other TXT file and change it's file extention to .KEY.\\n\\n_**Updating the SSL certificate in the F5 BIG-IP GUI.**_\\n\\nNow that you have a copy of the PEM file, or the CRT and KEY files, you can update the certificate in the F5 appliance.\\n\\n_For PKCS#7 certificates:_\\n\\n1. Click **System** > **File** **Management** > **SSL Certificate List**.\\n2. Click on the Certificate name you need to update then click the **Import** button.\\n3. Click **Browse** and locate the PEM file on your desktop.\\n4. Click **Import**.Type the password of the certificate if prompted to do so.\\n5. Verify that the certificate expiration date changed.\\n\\n_For PKCS#12 certificates:_\\n\\n1. Click **System** > **File Management** > **SSL Certificate List**.\\n2. Click on the Certificate name you need to update then click the **Import** button.\\n3. Click **Browse** and locate the CRT file on your desktop.\\n4. Click **Import**.\\n5. Select **KEY** from the Import Type drop-down menu. Type the authorization password if prompted, then click **Finish**.\\n6.

One of my first projects dealt with configuring our Cisco IOS switches to authenticate logins against our Active Directory accounts. This allows us to manage our network devices much easier, as well as helping to secure our devices by locking them down to actual user logins instead of relying on the local user databases for each device. Needless to say, it was NOT easy figuring out how to set up everything due to our infrastructure setup.

If you don’t have an ACS server and want to use a Windows RADIUS server instead, . \\n\\nSo, in starting this journey I had several pieces of equipment available: \\n\\n* 1x Cisco Secure ACS v4.2 appliance (hereby referred to as the ACS server)\\n* 1x Windows Server 2003 Server that is a member of a domain (a.k.a. member server)\\n* 1x Cisco Catalyst 3750X-48P Switch with IOS 12.2\\n\\nIf you have the same type of hardware or infrastructure setup as me, here is an extremely high level overview of exactly what I did to set up Active Directory authentication on the ACS server, TACACS+ configurations on the Cisco IOS switch, and setting up the Cisco Secure ACS Remote Agent software on the domain member server: \\n\\n1. Install and configure the Cisco Secure ACS Remote Agent software on the domain member server. Information on how to do this is [located on Cisco’s website here](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/secursw/ps5338/products_installation_and_configuration_guide_chapter09186a0080193aa0.html)\\n2. Add the Remote Agent under <u>Network Configuration</u> in the ACS server.\\n3. Set up Active Directory as an <u>External User Database</u> in the ACS server.\\n4. [Read Jose Leitao’s blog on how to do this here.](http://blog.initialdraft.com/archives/41/)\\n5. Set up user accounts in the ACS server for access to log into Cisco IOS devices.\\n6. Configure TACACS and AAA authentication on the Cisco IOS device. Again, I recommend testing logging into your IOS device before you decide to save this configuration (WRITE MEM \\\\ COPY START RUN) because if there is a problem, you can just restart the device without keeping the changes. Here is a sample configuration for your device from #: \\n\\nconfig t \\n\\ntacacs-server directed-request \\n\\ntacacs-server key <KEY FROM TACACS SERVER> \\n\\ntacacs-server host <IP ADDRESS OF TACACS SERVER> \\n\\naaa new-model \\n\\naaa authentication login default local group tacacs+ \\n\\naaa authentication login no-tacacs local \\n\\naaa authentication enable default group tacacs+ enable \\n\\naaa authorization console \\n\\naaa authorization config-commands \\n\\naaa authorization exec default group tacacs+ if-authenticated local \\n\\naaa authorization commands 1 default if-authenticated \\n\\naaa authorization commands 15 default local group tacacs+ \\n\\n[read Jose Leitao’s blog on how to do this here.](http://blog.initialdraft.com/archives/41/)\\n\\nThere are some caveats, or ‘gotchas’, with using a TACACS server to process login requests: \\n\\n* At logon, the IOS device will first check its local database for the user ID and password. If the user ID is not in the local database then IOS will then attempt to authenticate against the TACACS server.\\n* If the TACACS server is unavailable, the local account database on the network device will be used.\\n* You will need to create a ‘failsafe’ local user account on the ACS server in case there is a problem with Active Directory. See the next bullet point for the reason…\\n* If the ACS server is up and running but Active Directory is not working, a local ACS user account is the only thing that can be used. The reason why this is true is because IOS can still communicate with the ACS server. Just know that you need to use a local ACS user account if there is an Active Directory problem. And no, there is no workaround for this.\\n* ACS supports two different types of user accounts – “Local” and “External User Database”. When you create a user account in ACS, you must define if it is going to be local to the ACS server, or if the user account needs to authenticate against an external user database (in this case our external user database is MS Active Directory).\\n* With this configuration, when a user account successfully logs in they are automatically placed into ENABLE mode immediately. This reduces the need to retype passwords over and over again. This type of configuration is very close to a “single-sign-on” user experience for network devices.\\n* As long at the network device is able to communicate with the ACS server, authentication will ALWAYS occur with the ACS server.\\n* TACACS server authentication is a two way street. You need to add the network device as an AAA client in the ACS server, as well as configure the network device’s TACACS configuration.\\n\\nUtilize the resources from the embedded links in the steps above. That’s right. I am going to force you to learn how to do most of this on your own! But I hope that I did answer some of your questions about using a Cisco Secure ACS server and TACACS.

Install and configure the Cisco Secure ACS Remote Agent software on the\n    domain member server. Information on how to do this is located on Cisco’s\n    website here\n    [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/sw/secursw/ps5338/products_installation_and_configuration_guide_chapter09186a0080193aa0.html]\n 2. Add the Remote Agent under Network Configuration  in the ACS server.\n 3. Set up Active Directory as an External User Database  in the ACS server.\n 4. Read Jose Leitao’s blog on how to do this here.\n    [http://blog.initialdraft.com/archives/41/]\n 5. Set up user accounts in the ACS server for access to log into Cisco IOS\n    devices.\n 6. Configure TACACS and AAA authentication on the Cisco IOS device. Again, I\n    recommend testing logging into your IOS device before you decide to save\n    this configuration (WRITE MEM \\ COPY START RUN) because if there is a\n    problem, you can just restart the device without keeping the changes. Here\n    is a sample configuration for your device from #:\n\nconfig t\n\ntacacs-server directed-request\n\ntacacs-server key \n\ntacacs-server host \n\naaa new-model\n\naaa authentication login default local group tacacs+\n\naaa authentication login no-tacacs local\n\naaa authentication enable default group tacacs+ enable\n\naaa authorization console\n\naaa authorization config-commands\n\naaa authorization exec default group tacacs+ if-authenticated local\n\naaa authorization commands 1 default if-authenticated\n\naaa authorization commands 15 default local group tacacs+\n\nread Jose Leitao’s blog on how to do this here.\n[http://blog.initialdraft.com/archives/41/]\n\nThere are some caveats, or ‘gotchas’, with using a TACACS server to process\nlogin requests:\n\n * At logon, the IOS device will first check its local database for the user ID\n   and password. If the user ID is not in the local database then IOS will then\n   attempt to authenticate against the TACACS server.\n * If the TACACS server is unavailable, the local account database on the\n   network device will be used.\n * You will need to create a ‘failsafe’ local user account on the ACS server in\n   case there is a problem with Active Directory. See the next bullet point for\n   the reason…\n * If the ACS server is up and running but Active Directory is not working, a\n   local ACS user account is the only thing that can be used. The reason why\n   this is true is because IOS can still communicate with the ACS server. Just\n   know that you need to use a local ACS user account if there is an Active\n   Directory problem. And no, there is no workaround for this.\n * ACS supports two different types of user accounts – “Local” and “External\n   User Database”. When you create a user account in ACS, you must define if it\n   is going to be local to the ACS server, or if the user account needs to\n   authenticate against an external user database (in this case our external\n   user database is MS Active Directory).\n * With this configuration, when a user account successfully logs in they are\n   automatically placed into ENABLE mode immediately. This reduces the need to\n   retype passwords over and over again. This type of configuration is very\n   close to a “single-sign-on” user experience for network devices.\n * As long at the network device is able to communicate with the ACS server,\n   authentication will ALWAYS occur with the ACS server.\n * TACACS server authentication is a two way street. You need to add the network\n   device as an AAA client in the ACS server, as well as configure the network\n   device’s TACACS configuration.\n\nUtilize the resources from the embedded links in the steps above. That’s right.\nI am going to force you to learn how to do most of this on your own! But I hope\nthat I did answer some of your questions about using a Cisco Secure ACS server\nand TACACS. As always, feel free to send me an email if you need clarification\non any of these points.\nsee Brian Desmond’s Blog for instructions\n[http://briandesmond.com/blog/how-to-authenticate-against-active-directory-from-cisco-ios/]","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2012-05-10T22:00:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2012-05-21T04:10:36.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2012-05-10T22:00:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdcc6c","uuid":"fba13f2d-8fa5-4efd-b817-8b1f4894ed37","title":"Windows User Account Management using the Command Line","slug":"windows_user_account_management_using_the_command_line-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"Some friends of mine asked me to provide them one of my scripts that does the following things: \\n\\n1.

After I joined the PC to the domain, I made sure I had administrative rights![](http://www.dmxzone.com/downloads/images/_net_logo_2.jpg) to the laptop and started to install the applications I use on a regular basis. One of my applications required .NET Framework 3.5 to be installed on the computer before installing. A nice feature of Windows 8 is that if you attempt to install a program that requires .NET 3.5, a nice Windows prompt will appear telling you to enable the feature. I attempted to enable it, but I received an error. \\nWhy is .NET Framework 3.5 enabled by default in Windows 8? \\n\\n, .NET Framework 3.5 is now a part of \\\"Feature on Demand\\\" in Windows and is not enabled by default because the newer .NET 4.5 Framework feature is enabled instead. Framework v4.5 supports Metro Apps, not v3.5\\\\.

Since I am the type of guy that likes to be on the 'up-and-up' with technology I decided to take the plunge and use Windows 8 exclusively at work and at home and see how things stack up. Like many of my other I.T. peers, I had a fantastic experience with the Windows 7 Public Beta a few years back so it is because of that experience on why I have decided to use Windows 8 ahead of it's official release. But of course, another motive to me using Windows 8 is to see if it really is what it is cracked up to be and maybe, just maybe, I would be the local expert at my place of work when Windows 8 is officially released. I did use the Windows 8 Developer Preview and, to be honest, I didn't see much reason for a business or consumer to actually upgrade to the new OS. But, I had already read several first impressions about the Consumer Preview and it looks like Microsoft is headed in the right direction. Will Windows 8 still do what I need it to do at my business? Does the new Metro UI interfere with the way that I use Windows on my desktop? And of course, will Windows 8 be worth the upgrade? Lets dive in an take a look... \\n\\nInstallation and Upgrade: \\n[![](http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/windows-8-metro-apps1.jpg)](http://www.joedissmeyer.com)\\n\\nThe Clean Install on the Laptop: \\nThe clean install acts and performs just like a clean install when booting from a USB drive or DVD of Windows Vista or Windows 7\\\\. However, installation was surprisingly faster. Normally, it can take up to an hour for me to perform a clean install of Windows Vista until it boots to the \\\"out-of-box-experience\\\" (OOBE) first time boot screen. In Windows 7, it takes about 20 to 30 minutes for the computer to boot to the OOBE. But with Windows 8, I was at OOBE and up and running after only 14 minutes from start to finish.\\n\\nThe Upgrade Install on my Desktop: \\nAfter booting up in the burned DVD of Windows 8 and running setup.exe, I was first prompted to reboot my PC to continue probably because I didn't reboot after installing some Windows Updates. After I rebooted and logged back in to the desktop, I had to manually kick off setup.exe again. I only had to answer 3 questions and the Windows 8 installer handled everything else. To my surprise, the upgrade was smooth and seamless. I have never, EVER, had a smooth and seamless upgrade from one operating system to another so I was baffled! The installation only took an hour and I didn't have to re-install ANY of my applications or restore ANY of my files from my backup external hard drive. This is definitely a big win for Microsoft in my opinion. Those that want to upgrade to Windows 8 from Windows Vista or Windows 7 will no longer have to worry about re-installing all of their apps and copying back their data from a backup drive to their computer after the upgrade completes. This is a very good thing for everyone.\\n\\nDevice Drivers: \\nWindows 8 uses the exact same driver model as Windows Vista or Windows 7\\\\. As long as there is a driver available for your computer in Vista or Windows 7, you can install the hardware. Windows does a good enough job with finding and installing missing device drivers through Windows Update, but there is still some hardware that isn't detected during installation. An example of this scenario is with my Dell Latitude D630 that had the nVidia Quadro NVS discrete graphics. When I installed Windows 8 on the D630, the ONLY drivers missing were the nVidia graphics drivers. I had to download and install the Windows Vista driver pack from Dell's support site and viola, I had full graphics performance. All other hardware was detected and installed during Windows 8 Setup. \\nSomething else worth noting is that it no longer takes 5 to 30 seconds to install a driver for a mouse or keyboard in Windows 8\\\\. Windows 8 is now just as fast as Mac OS X Lion when plugging in a USB mouse - it only takes a second or two for the device to register and work as normal! I tried this out with several standard wired USB mice, as well as my Microsoft Explorer Touch Mouse that uses the Microsoft Bluetrack (not Bluetooth) micro USB dongle. As soon as I plugged in that micro USB dongle, the mouse was fully usable after a second. \\nBut back to video drivers, I did notice one thing with Windows 8 where even though I didn't have the graphics driver installed, I still had Windows Aero effects enabled. Apparently, Microsoft has decided to allow software acceleration for Aero if a video driver is missing. Video performance was very poor until I installed the nVidia driver (which is to be expected)...\\n\\nPerformance: \\nAfter using Windows 8 for only a few minutes I immediately noticed drastic performance improvements. Basically, everything is _**faster**_. Now I don't mean that things seem fast just because a new OS is installed on the computer. I really do mean that things are faster, _**really fast**_. Loading desktop applications, transferring and copying files to\\\\from the hard drive, and playing games on Windows 8 is simply faster. I don't know if any of you downloaded and worked with the Windows 7 Public Betas a few years back, but I explicitly remember loading up Windows 7 Beta on a test PC and it was amazingly fast, much faster than even Windows 2000 on a decent, modern, computer. Even after Windows 7 was officially released, Windows 7 is was the speed champion as far as Windows OSes are concerned. But now it is my opinion that Windows 8 is faster than Windows 7\\\\. You can definitely tell that Microsoft is not playing around with Windows 8 and they are tweaking and fixing things, making the OS much faster than one would expect.\\n\\nMonitors - Dual Screens, Widescreen displays, and Standard displays: \\nI operate in a dual monitor environment on my work desktop. It is a Dell OptiPlex 780 with an ATI Radeon HD 4550 512mb dual head video card, 4GB of RAM, and a dual core Intel Core i5 processor. Both of my monitors are Dell 19 inch standard square monitors (not widescreen) with a maximum resolution of 1280x1024 per screen. The best feature regarding dual monitors is that Microsoft has finally spanned the toolbar across all monitor windows so I no longer have to install the Multimon 2.1 app on my deskop. Windows 8 also comes with a few very wide desktop backgrounds that span multiple monitors. My laptop has a 1440x900 widescreen display and I had the same experience.\\n\\nThe New Start - Welcome to Metro UI: \\nStart is the first thing you see when you boot up the computer and log into it for the first time. Here is one very important concept that you need to understand with Windows 8 - Start is Metro UI. I will say that again - _**<u>Start IS Metro UI</u>**_. Chances are that in the future, we will probably all begin to start referring to \\\"Start\\\" as \\\"Metro\\\" and use the terms interchangeably. So, expect to hear someone say, \\\"Go back to Metro\\\" and at the same time they mean \\\"Go back to Start\\\". The sooner you understand this concept the sooner you will find yourself immersed in the new design of Windows 8\\\\. I am willing to bet that the more you use Metro in Windows 8, you will find that the Metro design simply makes sense and I know that you will find that it is easier to use than the old Start Menus of previous versions of Windows. In my opinion, this is one more big win for Microsoft because every new user to Windows OS has to learn the old Start Menu concepts and it is not an easy thing to learn right off the bat. If you are using a tablet or touchscreen, you will be using Metro quite often. If you are using a laptop or desktop PC, you probably won't be using Start\\\\Metro as often as you think. It may seem intimidating at first, but if you are like me you will find that the new Start is very easy to understand and work with. So lets get started.... \\nAll operating system software from Microsoft and Apple is trending to make all applications, features, accessories, or any other type of launchable application appear as a modular \\\"app\\\" accessible from an app icon on your home view. This is much like an app on your iPhone or Android device. The Windows Desktop is no exception to this rule. So in Windows 8, when you want to go back to the desktop view, simply click on the Desktop \\\"app\\\" tile from Start. \\nIf you haven't noticed, there is no more \\\"Start Menu\\\" available from the desktop in Windows 8\\\\. There is no more Start Button on the task bar and there is no All Programs list. Instead, you must become accustomed to using the new Metro interface and the new \\\"Start\\\" is a part of that interface. Believe it or not, working with the new Start is much easier and much faster compared to the traditional Start Menu from the Windows OSes of old. To be honest, the new Start just makes sense. To get to Start, just move the mouse cursor to the very top or bottom left of the computer screen. A small thumbnail will appear. Click on it to go back to Start. Of course, you could also just hit the Windows key on your keyboard. \\nSearch is a BIG part of how to work with Start. If there is an application you want to run, just start typing while Start is displayed on screen. If there is an email that you want to read, or need to find some type of information in a document, just start typing what you are looking for while Start is onscreen. Once you try this just ONCE, you will be hooked. You just cannot screw this up. It's foolproof! Also notice that as you install applications, new app tiles appear in Start just like an application icon or folder would appear in All Programs in the Start Menu in Windows 7 or Windows XP. One would think that the new Start doesn't work well in the business world but I beg the differ. The old start menu in itself has been a problem ever since Windows NT and Windows 95\\\\. The old Start Menu is buggy and never worked perfectly, even in Windows 7\\\\. This new start in Metro UI is definitely a breath of fresh air and frankly, it just makes sense.\\n\\nThe Desktop: \\nYou will immediately notice that the desktop view looks almost identical to the Windows 7 desktop except that there is no more Start button (Start Orb) or Start Menu. In fact, EXPLORER.EXE is still the main part of the Windows Desktop experience and EXPLORER.EXE does run as soon as you start up the computer. If you are like me and don't have a tablet PC or touchscreen laptop, you will be working in desktop view most of the time that you use Windows 8\\\\. So for those that gripe about the new Start in Windows 8, I say \\\"Who cares!\\\". What I have done is pin my most commonly used applications to the taskbar in the Desktop View. Doing this allows me to stay in Desktop view 95% of the time that I use my Windows 8 computers. Any apps that I need to quickly use, I perform the Windows+R keyboard shortcut to open the Run box and execute a command, or quickly hit the Windows key on the keyboard, type the app or feature name, then hit enter to launch that computer.\\n\\nHotspots: \\nHotspots are the key to multitasking with Metro UI in Windows 8\\\\. Hotspots are the very top or bottom left corners of the display window. The bottom left gets you into Start, the top left is your app switcher much like hitting Alt+Tab on the keyboard however Alt-Tab only works on the desktop and the hotspot only works with Metro UI. If you have several Metro UI apps launched, such as the Windows Desktop and Remote Desktop, simply move the mouse cursor to the top left of the screen and wait a second for the first app thumbnail to display. Hover the cursor over the app for a moment, and a left sidebar will appear onscreen displaying all of the open Metro apps, including Start at the bottom. So now you know that you work with hotspots in Windows 8 when in either Desktop or Metro UI view and to get back to Start you work with hotspots. Move the mouse cursor to the very bottom left of the display and you will see a thumbnail of Start. Click on that thumbnail to return to Start. It's that simple.\\n\\nCharms: \\nCharms is something new in Windows 8 and are quick shortcuts to common tasks while inside of an app. It operates like hotspots, but instead of the left side of the screen Charms are on the right side. Charms are designed to mostly be used while inside of a Metro App, but can be used from the desktop view. They provide high level OS operations like go back to start, search, manage devices, or configure settings. I rarely use Charms in the Desktop view. But again, Charms are not really designed for desktop view anyways. Charms are designed to be used from Metro apps. I like that Microsoft moved Charms to the right of the primary monitor screen where the Show Desktop button in Windows 7 used to be. I never used the Show Desktop feature anyways and the Charm display is now out of my way. The only unfortunate thing in the new design is that the only way to Shut Down or Restart Windows 8 is from the Settings Charm. But, this is just another thing to get used to in Windows 8.\\n\\nKeyboard Shortcuts: \\nSince I work in IT, I am used to opening the Run box and launching the command line from the Start Menu in Windows 7\\\\. Since the Start Menu is now gone for good, I am being forced to learning the Windows shortcuts to launch the run box instead of clicking Start > Run. Of course, I could just open Start and type \\\"cmd\\\" to search, then launch the command line app. But hitting Windows+R on the keyboard is much, much, faster. Frankly, I am glad that Microsoft is forcing IT Professionals _actually_ learn how to become a keyboard junkie :)\\n\\nRemote Desktop: \\nRDC is a common application used to remotely connect to a server or desktop computer. Microsoft has provided a Metro app in Start called \\\"Remote Desktop\\\". This is the same app as the classic RDC client but it runs in full screen mode. Unfortunately, I have had issues with the RDC Metro App crashing, or not allowing me to exit from a current RDC connection even after I have logged out. But one good thing about the Remote Desktop Metro App is that it has built-in 'tabs'. The tabs allows you to be able to have multiple RDC connections open at once, then switch between them on demand within the app. Luckily, Microsoft has not taken out MSTSC.EXE from Windows 8\\\\. Naturally, I still prefer launching MSTSC.EXE from Run or the Command Line and if I need tabbed views, I still prefer Terminals.\\n\\nWindows Explorer: \\nThe Ribbon being built into Windows Explorer is definitely a breath of fresh air. No longer do I have to deal with trying to find the correct context menu options when I right-click on a file to perform some specific file maintenance tasks. Also, the ISO mounting ability is a nice addition. But Explorer is where Microsoft finally went back to fix some issues. For example, have you ever noticed how long it takes to copy and paste a file from one location to another in Windows Vista? The file would finish copying but Explorer would take a few extra seconds to finish the job and close the progress bar pop-up. This issue happens in Windows 7 too, but performance is a bit better than in Vista. Well, with Windows 8 Microsoft finally 'fixed' the problem and it no longer takes extra time to finish the file maintenance task.\\n\\nTask Manager: \\nThe old task manager from Windows 7 and before is just plain terrible. I have been using the Sysinternals tool Process Monitor instead, which basically is a beefed up Task Manager on steroids. Microsoft finally took some cues from that app and made the default Windows Task Manager smarter by adding some of the display features from Process Monitor. No longer do you need to guess what EXE programs are actually running since Task Manager now will show that information. Also, Task Manager incorporates several Administrative Tools into the app such as the Services tab (services.msc), Startup tab (from MSConfig tool), and a tab that shows App History. The new Task Manager is not designed to be a replacement for Process Monitor, but the new Task Manager is finally shaping up to be a useful tool. Why Microsoft never caught on to this in the past I will never know.\\n\\nWindows Media Center: \\nWMC in the Windows 8 Consumer Preview is exactly the same as the version in Windows 7\\\\. I never really used WMC so I don't have any major complaints or praises about it. But When I did launch it, it surprised me to find that when I chose the Express setup it didn't take several minutes for the scan to finish, it just went straight to the app. So I guess that was a pleasant surprise...0\\n\\nIssues that I have Experienced: \\nYes, I have had several issues over the past week with Windows 8 but to be honest, I think that these issues are to be expected since this is unfinished and unsupported software. The first issue I had was a blue screen of death and was one of the common \\\"nonfault page\\\" BSOD errors. This happened when I had at least 5 different applications open from the desktop and 3 different Metro apps running all at the same time. When I attempted to open a 4th Metro app the BSOD displayed and Windows automatically restarted after a few seconds. However, I have not had a BSOD since and it appears this issue was a one off type of situation. \\nAnother issue I had was when I was when I was attempting to install Evernote. I downloaded the EXE from Evernote.com and double-clicked on the installer file but nothing happened. Then, when I attempted to launch Explorer, Windows locked up. I could still move the mouse and strangely I could still go back to Metro UI and I could still launch Task Manager. But when I went back to the desktop, the view was completely locked up. I had to log out then log back in to fix the problem. \\nMy final issue that I have experienced was with installing an app from the Windows Store. I started the download for the app, but the download suddenly stopped and went back to the Store app. This had happened to me on several different occassions. But as soon as I attempt to install the app again, everything works just fine.\\n\\nMy Final Thoughts on the Windows 8 Consumer Preview: \\nMy experience so far has been great. Yes, I have had a few issues but nothing like some of the really really bad problems I have experienced with Windows XP general use or Windows Vista betas. Even though the Windows 8 official release is still several months away, it is clear that Microsoft is on the right track to fixing any remaining issues and finalizing the user interface with the desktop and Metro UI. Personally, I don't mind using the Windows 8 Consumer Preview as my primary OS at work and at home. I am already starting to prefer using Windows 8 over Windows 7 even with the new Metro UI. It is simply easy for me to work with the new interface and the fact that Microsoft is forcing me to be a \\\"keyboard junkie\\\" by learning shortcuts and learning how to work around the operating system interfaces makes me like the OS even more. Even at this time, I do prefer using Metro as the Start Menu. While I think Windows 8 still does need some more tweaking here and there, given more development time I'm sure it will be a fantastic product.\\n\\nWill Windows 8 be worth the upgrade when it is released? ....

But of course, another motive to me using Windows 8 is to see if it really is what it is cracked up to be and maybe, just maybe, I would be the local expert at my place of work when Windows 8 is officially released. I did use the Windows 8 Developer Preview and, to be honest, I didn't see much reason for a business or consumer to actually upgrade to the new OS. But, I had already read several first impressions about the Consumer Preview and it looks like Microsoft is headed in the right direction. Will Windows 8 still do what I need it to do at my business? Does the new Metro UI interfere with the way that I use Windows on my desktop? And of course, will Windows 8 be worth the upgrade? Lets dive in an take a look...</p>\n<p>Installation and Upgrade:<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.joedissmeyer.com\"><img src=\"http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/windows-8-metro-apps1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>The Clean Install on the Laptop:<br>\nThe clean install acts and performs just like a clean install when booting from a USB drive or DVD of Windows Vista or Windows 7. However, installation was surprisingly faster. Normally, it can take up to an hour for me to perform a clean install of Windows Vista until it boots to the &quot;out-of-box-experience&quot; (OOBE) first time boot screen. In Windows 7, it takes about 20 to 30 minutes for the computer to boot to the OOBE. But with Windows 8, I was at OOBE and up and running after only 14 minutes from start to finish.</p>\n<p>The Upgrade Install on my Desktop:<br>\nAfter booting up in the burned DVD of Windows 8 and running setup.exe, I was first prompted to reboot my PC to continue probably because I didn't reboot after installing some Windows Updates. After I rebooted and logged back in to the desktop, I had to manually kick off setup.exe again. I only had to answer 3 questions and the Windows 8 installer handled everything else. To my surprise, the upgrade was smooth and seamless. I have never, EVER, had a smooth and seamless upgrade from one operating system to another so I was baffled! The installation only took an hour and I didn't have to re-install ANY of my applications or restore ANY of my files from my backup external hard drive. This is definitely a big win for Microsoft in my opinion. Those that want to upgrade to Windows 8 from Windows Vista or Windows 7 will no longer have to worry about re-installing all of their apps and copying back their data from a backup drive to their computer after the upgrade completes. This is a very good thing for everyone.</p>\n<p>Device Drivers:<br>\nWindows 8 uses the exact same driver model as Windows Vista or Windows 7. As long as there is a driver available for your computer in Vista or Windows 7, you can install the hardware. Windows does a good enough job with finding and installing missing device drivers through Windows Update, but there is still some hardware that isn't detected during installation. An example of this scenario is with my Dell Latitude D630 that had the nVidia Quadro NVS discrete graphics. When I installed Windows 8 on the D630, the ONLY drivers missing were the nVidia graphics drivers. I had to download and install the Windows Vista driver pack from Dell's support site and viola, I had full graphics performance. All other hardware was detected and installed during Windows 8 Setup.<br>\nSomething else worth noting is that it no longer takes 5 to 30 seconds to install a driver for a mouse or keyboard in Windows 8. Windows 8 is now just as fast as Mac OS X Lion when plugging in a USB mouse - it only takes a second or two for the device to register and work as normal! I tried this out with several standard wired USB mice, as well as my Microsoft Explorer Touch Mouse that uses the Microsoft Bluetrack (not Bluetooth) micro USB dongle. As soon as I plugged in that micro USB dongle, the mouse was fully usable after a second.<br>\nBut back to video drivers, I did notice one thing with Windows 8 where even though I didn't have the graphics driver installed, I still had Windows Aero effects enabled. Apparently, Microsoft has decided to allow software acceleration for Aero if a video driver is missing. Video performance was very poor until I installed the nVidia driver (which is to be expected)...</p>\n<p>Performance:<br>\nAfter using Windows 8 for only a few minutes I immediately noticed drastic performance improvements. Basically, everything is <em><strong>faster</strong></em>. Now I don't mean that things seem fast just because a new OS is installed on the computer. I really do mean that things are faster, <em><strong>really fast</strong></em>. Loading desktop applications, transferring and copying files to\\from the hard drive, and playing games on Windows 8 is simply faster. I don't know if any of you downloaded and worked with the Windows 7 Public Betas a few years back, but I explicitly remember loading up Windows 7 Beta on a test PC and it was amazingly fast, much faster than even Windows 2000 on a decent, modern, computer. Even after Windows 7 was officially released, Windows 7 is was the speed champion as far as Windows OSes are concerned. But now it is my opinion that Windows 8 is faster than Windows 7. You can definitely tell that Microsoft is not playing around with Windows 8 and they are tweaking and fixing things, making the OS much faster than one would expect.</p>\n<p>Monitors - Dual Screens, Widescreen displays, and Standard displays:<br>\nI operate in a dual monitor environment on my work desktop. It is a Dell OptiPlex 780 with an ATI Radeon HD 4550 512mb dual head video card, 4GB of RAM, and a dual core Intel Core i5 processor. Both of my monitors are Dell 19 inch standard square monitors (not widescreen) with a maximum resolution of 1280x1024 per screen. The best feature regarding dual monitors is that Microsoft has finally spanned the toolbar across all monitor windows so I no longer have to install the Multimon 2.1 app on my deskop. Windows 8 also comes with a few very wide desktop backgrounds that span multiple monitors. My laptop has a 1440x900 widescreen display and I had the same experience.</p>\n<p>The New Start - Welcome to Metro UI:<br>\nStart is the first thing you see when you boot up the computer and log into it for the first time. Here is one very important concept that you need to understand with Windows 8 - Start is Metro UI. I will say that again - <em><strong><u>Start IS Metro UI</u></strong></em>. Chances are that in the future, we will probably all begin to start referring to &quot;Start&quot; as &quot;Metro&quot; and use the terms interchangeably. So, expect to hear someone say, &quot;Go back to Metro&quot; and at the same time they mean &quot;Go back to Start&quot;. The sooner you understand this concept the sooner you will find yourself immersed in the new design of Windows 8. I am willing to bet that the more you use Metro in Windows 8, you will find that the Metro design simply makes sense and I know that you will find that it is easier to use than the old Start Menus of previous versions of Windows. In my opinion, this is one more big win for Microsoft because every new user to Windows OS has to learn the old Start Menu concepts and it is not an easy thing to learn right off the bat. If you are using a tablet or touchscreen, you will be using Metro quite often. If you are using a laptop or desktop PC, you probably won't be using Start\\Metro as often as you think. It may seem intimidating at first, but if you are like me you will find that the new Start is very easy to understand and work with. So lets get started....<br>\nAll operating system software from Microsoft and Apple is trending to make all applications, features, accessories, or any other type of launchable application appear as a modular &quot;app&quot; accessible from an app icon on your home view. This is much like an app on your iPhone or Android device. The Windows Desktop is no exception to this rule. So in Windows 8, when you want to go back to the desktop view, simply click on the Desktop &quot;app&quot; tile from Start.<br>\nIf you haven't noticed, there is no more &quot;Start Menu&quot; available from the desktop in Windows 8. There is no more Start Button on the task bar and there is no All Programs list. Instead, you must become accustomed to using the new Metro interface and the new &quot;Start&quot; is a part of that interface. Believe it or not, working with the new Start is much easier and much faster compared to the traditional Start Menu from the Windows OSes of old. To be honest, the new Start just makes sense. To get to Start, just move the mouse cursor to the very top or bottom left of the computer screen. A small thumbnail will appear. Click on it to go back to Start. Of course, you could also just hit the Windows key on your keyboard.<br>\nSearch is a BIG part of how to work with Start. If there is an application you want to run, just start typing while Start is displayed on screen. If there is an email that you want to read, or need to find some type of information in a document, just start typing what you are looking for while Start is onscreen. Once you try this just ONCE, you will be hooked. You just cannot screw this up. It's foolproof! Also notice that as you install applications, new app tiles appear in Start just like an application icon or folder would appear in All Programs in the Start Menu in Windows 7 or Windows XP. One would think that the new Start doesn't work well in the business world but I beg the differ. The old start menu in itself has been a problem ever since Windows NT and Windows 95. The old Start Menu is buggy and never worked perfectly, even in Windows 7. This new start in Metro UI is definitely a breath of fresh air and frankly, it just makes sense.</p>\n<p>The Desktop:<br>\nYou will immediately notice that the desktop view looks almost identical to the Windows 7 desktop except that there is no more Start button (Start Orb) or Start Menu. In fact, EXPLORER.EXE is still the main part of the Windows Desktop experience and EXPLORER.EXE does run as soon as you start up the computer. If you are like me and don't have a tablet PC or touchscreen laptop, you will be working in desktop view most of the time that you use Windows 8. So for those that gripe about the new Start in Windows 8, I say &quot;Who cares!&quot;. What I have done is pin my most commonly used applications to the taskbar in the Desktop View. Doing this allows me to stay in Desktop view 95% of the time that I use my Windows 8 computers. Any apps that I need to quickly use, I perform the Windows+R keyboard shortcut to open the Run box and execute a command, or quickly hit the Windows key on the keyboard, type the app or feature name, then hit enter to launch that computer.</p>\n<p>Hotspots:<br>\nHotspots are the key to multitasking with Metro UI in Windows 8. Hotspots are the very top or bottom left corners of the display window. The bottom left gets you into Start, the top left is your app switcher much like hitting Alt+Tab on the keyboard however Alt-Tab only works on the desktop and the hotspot only works with Metro UI. If you have several Metro UI apps launched, such as the Windows Desktop and Remote Desktop, simply move the mouse cursor to the top left of the screen and wait a second for the first app thumbnail to display. Hover the cursor over the app for a moment, and a left sidebar will appear onscreen displaying all of the open Metro apps, including Start at the bottom. So now you know that you work with hotspots in Windows 8 when in either Desktop or Metro UI view and to get back to Start you work with hotspots. Move the mouse cursor to the very bottom left of the display and you will see a thumbnail of Start. Click on that thumbnail to return to Start. It's that simple.</p>\n<p>Charms:<br>\nCharms is something new in Windows 8 and are quick shortcuts to common tasks while inside of an app. It operates like hotspots, but instead of the left side of the screen Charms are on the right side. Charms are designed to mostly be used while inside of a Metro App, but can be used from the desktop view. They provide high level OS operations like go back to start, search, manage devices, or configure settings. I rarely use Charms in the Desktop view. But again, Charms are not really designed for desktop view anyways. Charms are designed to be used from Metro apps. I like that Microsoft moved Charms to the right of the primary monitor screen where the Show Desktop button in Windows 7 used to be. I never used the Show Desktop feature anyways and the Charm display is now out of my way. The only unfortunate thing in the new design is that the only way to Shut Down or Restart Windows 8 is from the Settings Charm. But, this is just another thing to get used to in Windows 8.</p>\n<p>Keyboard Shortcuts:<br>\nSince I work in IT, I am used to opening the Run box and launching the command line from the Start Menu in Windows 7. Since the Start Menu is now gone for good, I am being forced to learning the Windows shortcuts to launch the run box instead of clicking Start &gt; Run. Of course, I could just open Start and type &quot;cmd&quot; to search, then launch the command line app. But hitting Windows+R on the keyboard is much, much, faster. Frankly, I am glad that Microsoft is forcing IT Professionals <em>actually</em> learn how to become a keyboard junkie :)</p>\n<p>Remote Desktop:<br>\nRDC is a common application used to remotely connect to a server or desktop computer. Microsoft has provided a Metro app in Start called &quot;Remote Desktop&quot;. This is the same app as the classic RDC client but it runs in full screen mode. Unfortunately, I have had issues with the RDC Metro App crashing, or not allowing me to exit from a current RDC connection even after I have logged out. But one good thing about the Remote Desktop Metro App is that it has built-in 'tabs'. The tabs allows you to be able to have multiple RDC connections open at once, then switch between them on demand within the app. Luckily, Microsoft has not taken out MSTSC.EXE from Windows 8. Naturally, I still prefer launching MSTSC.EXE from Run or the Command Line and if I need tabbed views, I still prefer Terminals.</p>\n<p>Windows Explorer:<br>\nThe Ribbon being built into Windows Explorer is definitely a breath of fresh air. No longer do I have to deal with trying to find the correct context menu options when I right-click on a file to perform some specific file maintenance tasks. Also, the ISO mounting ability is a nice addition. But Explorer is where Microsoft finally went back to fix some issues. For example, have you ever noticed how long it takes to copy and paste a file from one location to another in Windows Vista? The file would finish copying but Explorer would take a few extra seconds to finish the job and close the progress bar pop-up. This issue happens in Windows 7 too, but performance is a bit better than in Vista. Well, with Windows 8 Microsoft finally 'fixed' the problem and it no longer takes extra time to finish the file maintenance task.</p>\n<p>Task Manager:<br>\nThe old task manager from Windows 7 and before is just plain terrible. I have been using the Sysinternals tool Process Monitor instead, which basically is a beefed up Task Manager on steroids. Microsoft finally took some cues from that app and made the default Windows Task Manager smarter by adding some of the display features from Process Monitor. No longer do you need to guess what EXE programs are actually running since Task Manager now will show that information. Also, Task Manager incorporates several Administrative Tools into the app such as the Services tab (services.msc), Startup tab (from MSConfig tool), and a tab that shows App History. The new Task Manager is not designed to be a replacement for Process Monitor, but the new Task Manager is finally shaping up to be a useful tool. Why Microsoft never caught on to this in the past I will never know.</p>\n<p>Windows Media Center:<br>\nWMC in the Windows 8 Consumer Preview is exactly the same as the version in Windows 7. I never really used WMC so I don't have any major complaints or praises about it. But When I did launch it, it surprised me to find that when I chose the Express setup it didn't take several minutes for the scan to finish, it just went straight to the app. So I guess that was a pleasant surprise...0</p>\n<p>Issues that I have Experienced:<br>\nYes, I have had several issues over the past week with Windows 8 but to be honest, I think that these issues are to be expected since this is unfinished and unsupported software. The first issue I had was a blue screen of death and was one of the common &quot;nonfault page&quot; BSOD errors. This happened when I had at least 5 different applications open from the desktop and 3 different Metro apps running all at the same time. When I attempted to open a 4th Metro app the BSOD displayed and Windows automatically restarted after a few seconds. However, I have not had a BSOD since and it appears this issue was a one off type of situation.<br>\nAnother issue I had was when I was when I was attempting to install Evernote. I downloaded the EXE from Evernote.com and double-clicked on the installer file but nothing happened. Then, when I attempted to launch Explorer, Windows locked up. I could still move the mouse and strangely I could still go back to Metro UI and I could still launch Task Manager. But when I went back to the desktop, the view was completely locked up. I had to log out then log back in to fix the problem.<br>\nMy final issue that I have experienced was with installing an app from the Windows Store. I started the download for the app, but the download suddenly stopped and went back to the Store app. This had happened to me on several different occassions. But as soon as I attempt to install the app again, everything works just fine.</p>\n<p>My Final Thoughts on the Windows 8 Consumer Preview:<br>\nMy experience so far has been great. Yes, I have had a few issues but nothing like some of the really really bad problems I have experienced with Windows XP general use or Windows Vista betas. Even though the Windows 8 official release is still several months away, it is clear that Microsoft is on the right track to fixing any remaining issues and finalizing the user interface with the desktop and Metro UI. Personally, I don't mind using the Windows 8 Consumer Preview as my primary OS at work and at home. I am already starting to prefer using Windows 8 over Windows 7 even with the new Metro UI. It is simply easy for me to work with the new interface and the fact that Microsoft is forcing me to be a &quot;keyboard junkie&quot; by learning shortcuts and learning how to work around the operating system interfaces makes me like the OS even more. Even at this time, I do prefer using Metro as the Start Menu. While I think Windows 8 still does need some more tweaking here and there, given more development time I'm sure it will be a fantastic product.</p>\n<p>Will Windows 8 be worth the upgrade when it is released? .... Ask me again when it is closer to the official release date...</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","comment_id":"73","plaintext":"The Windows 8 Consumer Preview (a.k.a. the Windows 8 Public Beta #1) was\nreleased on February 29, 2012.

Basically, everything is faster. Now I don't mean that\nthings seem fast just because a new OS is installed on the computer. I really do\nmean that things are faster, really fast.

Since the Start Menu is now gone for\ngood, I am being forced to learning the Windows shortcuts to launch the run box\ninstead of clicking Start > Run. Of course, I could just open Start and type\n\"cmd\" to search, then launch the command line app. But hitting Windows+R on the\nkeyboard is much, much, faster. Frankly, I am glad that Microsoft is forcing IT\nProfessionals actually  learn how to become a keyboard junkie :)\n\nRemote Desktop:\nRDC is a common application used to remotely connect to a server or desktop\ncomputer. Microsoft has provided a Metro app in Start called \"Remote Desktop\".\nThis is the same app as the classic RDC client but it runs in full screen mode.\nUnfortunately, I have had issues with the RDC Metro App crashing, or not\nallowing me to exit from a current RDC connection even after I have logged out.\nBut one good thing about the Remote Desktop Metro App is that it has built-in\n'tabs'. The tabs allows you to be able to have multiple RDC connections open at\nonce, then switch between them on demand within the app. Luckily, Microsoft has\nnot taken out MSTSC.EXE from Windows 8. Naturally, I still prefer launching\nMSTSC.EXE from Run or the Command Line and if I need tabbed views, I still\nprefer Terminals.\n\nWindows Explorer:\nThe Ribbon being built into Windows Explorer is definitely a breath of fresh\nair. No longer do I have to deal with trying to find the correct context menu\noptions when I right-click on a file to perform some specific file maintenance\ntasks. Also, the ISO mounting ability is a nice addition. But Explorer is where\nMicrosoft finally went back to fix some issues. For example, have you ever\nnoticed how long it takes to copy and paste a file from one location to another\nin Windows Vista? The file would finish copying but Explorer would take a few\nextra seconds to finish the job and close the progress bar pop-up. This issue\nhappens in Windows 7 too, but performance is a bit better than in Vista. Well,\nwith Windows 8 Microsoft finally 'fixed' the problem and it no longer takes\nextra time to finish the file maintenance task.\n\nTask Manager:\nThe old task manager from Windows 7 and before is just plain terrible. I have\nbeen using the Sysinternals tool Process Monitor instead, which basically is a\nbeefed up Task Manager on steroids. Microsoft finally took some cues from that\napp and made the default Windows Task Manager smarter by adding some of the\ndisplay features from Process Monitor. No longer do you need to guess what EXE\nprograms are actually running since Task Manager now will show that information.\nAlso, Task Manager incorporates several Administrative Tools into the app such\nas the Services tab (services.msc), Startup tab (from MSConfig tool), and a tab\nthat shows App History. The new Task Manager is not designed to be a replacement\nfor Process Monitor, but the new Task Manager is finally shaping up to be a\nuseful tool. Why Microsoft never caught on to this in the past I will never\nknow.\n\nWindows Media Center:\nWMC in the Windows 8 Consumer Preview is exactly the same as the version in\nWindows 7. I never really used WMC so I don't have any major complaints or\npraises about it. But When I did launch it, it surprised me to find that when I\nchose the Express setup it didn't take several minutes for the scan to finish,\nit just went straight to the app. So I guess that was a pleasant surprise...0\n\nIssues that I have Experienced:\nYes, I have had several issues over the past week with Windows 8 but to be\nhonest, I think that these issues are to be expected since this is unfinished\nand unsupported software. The first issue I had was a blue screen of death and\nwas one of the common \"nonfault page\" BSOD errors. This happened when I had at\nleast 5 different applications open from the desktop and 3 different Metro apps\nrunning all at the same time. When I attempted to open a 4th Metro app the BSOD\ndisplayed and Windows automatically restarted after a few seconds. However, I\nhave not had a BSOD since and it appears this issue was a one off type of\nsituation.\nAnother issue I had was when I was when I was attempting to install Evernote. I\ndownloaded the EXE from Evernote.com and double-clicked on the installer file\nbut nothing happened. Then, when I attempted to launch Explorer, Windows locked\nup. I could still move the mouse and strangely I could still go back to Metro UI\nand I could still launch Task Manager. But when I went back to the desktop, the\nview was completely locked up. I had to log out then log back in to fix the\nproblem.\nMy final issue that I have experienced was with installing an app from the\nWindows Store. I started the download for the app, but the download suddenly\nstopped and went back to the Store app. This had happened to me on several\ndifferent occassions. But as soon as I attempt to install the app again,\neverything works just fine.\n\nMy Final Thoughts on the Windows 8 Consumer Preview:\nMy experience so far has been great. Yes, I have had a few issues but nothing\nlike some of the really really bad problems I have experienced with Windows XP\ngeneral use or Windows Vista betas. Even though the Windows 8 official release\nis still several months away, it is clear that Microsoft is on the right track\nto fixing any remaining issues and finalizing the user interface with the\ndesktop and Metro UI. Personally, I don't mind using the Windows 8 Consumer\nPreview as my primary OS at work and at home. I am already starting to prefer\nusing Windows 8 over Windows 7 even with the new Metro UI. It is simply easy for\nme to work with the new interface and the fact that Microsoft is forcing me to\nbe a \"keyboard junkie\" by learning shortcuts and learning how to work around the\noperating system interfaces makes me like the OS even more. Even at this time, I\ndo prefer using Metro as the Start Menu. While I think Windows 8 still does need\nsome more tweaking here and there, given more development time I'm sure it will\nbe a fantastic product.\n\nWill Windows 8 be worth the upgrade when it is released? .... Ask me again when\nit is closer to the official release date...","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2012-03-12T22:00:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2012-03-12T22:00:05.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2012-03-12T22:00:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdcc78","uuid":"16ef184e-4dad-47c1-aac7-38d6fc6cf397","title":"The Windows 8 Family of Software: Betas and Consumer Previews","slug":"the_windows_8_family_of_software_betas_and_consumer_previews-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"We all know that the Windows 8 Consumer Preview was released on Feb. 29th 2012\\\\.

Advanced format drives use 4k sectors instead of the traditional 512 byte sectors. When you deploy an operating system to an AFHDD, you must align partitions to the new advanced 4k sectors rather than the traditional 512 byte sectors. Windows 7 with SP1 does this automatically on your behalf during OS installation\\\\deployment, Windows 7 RTM and Windows XP does not. If you do not format an Advanced Format disk aligned on the 4k sectors, then you start to experience drive errors, performance issues, and possibly data loss. \\n\\nIn order to deploy a Windows XP image using MDT to a computer with an AFHDD you must build a new image and manually customize the sysprep and unattend files in your Sysprep and Capture task sequence, omitting the variable “ExtendOEMPartition”. ExtendOEMPartition is not needed because MDT task sequences automatically handle formatting drives and extending partitions inside of WinPE during OS deployment. \\n\\nHow to remove the ExtendOEMPartition variable for Windows XP Sysprep and Capture Task Sequences: \\n\\n1.

I was able to help out a family member with a strange networking issue.\nThey set up a very simple Windows file share on a Windows 7 computer and was\nattempting to access that share from a Windows XP computer on the same network.\nHere is the error screen that popped up:\n“System error 58 has occurred. The specified server cannot perform the requested\noperation.”\nTo me, this was an access issue; something permissions or rights related. As it\nturns out, I was only %50 correct. I found the resolution to this issue on . The\nproblem originates with Windows 7. Here are the steps to take to resolve the\nproblem:\n\n 1. On the Windows 7 computer that is hosting the file share, open the registry\n    and edit the following keys:\n\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management\n\nChange the value in \"LargeSystemCache\" to 1.\n2. HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanmanServer\\Parameters\n\nChange the value in \"Size\" to 3.\n3. Open GPedit.msc from Start > Run.\n4. Navigate to Windows Settings > Local Policies > Security Options.\n5. Locate “Network Security: LAN Manager Authentication Level” in the list and\ndouble-click it.\n6. Change the setting from “Send NTMLv2 response only” to “Send LM & NTLM – use\nNTLMv2 session if negotiated”.\n7. Restart the computer.\n\nAlan LaMielle’s blog\n[http://alan.lamielle.net/2009/09/03/windows-7-nonpaged-pool-srv-error-2017]","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2011-12-21T02:49:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2011-12-21T03:31:00.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2011-12-21T02:49:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdcc7e","uuid":"1d3bfd89-3eed-4e8f-9b6a-301a293213bd","title":"Scan a computer for malware, offline","slug":"scan_a_computer_for_malware_offline-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I’m too lazy tonight to write a full article on the new Windows Defender Offline Scan[![](http://software77.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/windows-defender-free.png)](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/what-is-windows-defender-offline)\\n\\n“Sometimes, malicious and other potentially unwanted software, including rootkits, try to install themselves on your PC.

It is nice to have wireless freedom with a laptop isn’t it? You are not tied to a desk anymore if you want to go online or play a game. But, the downside is that many printers (especially older printers) still require some type of physical cable or device in order to allow you to send print jobs to a printer. How can we make it so that it is possible to print to an existing printer wirelessly?\\n\\nFirst off, almost all new printers have wireless capability and they are extremely easy to set up. All that you need is a wireless network at home (Chances are, if you have a laptop you already have a wireless router set up in your home.) You can find wireless capable printers at any major retailer, such as Wal-Mart or Target, that has either Apple’s AirPrint or Google’s Cloud Print technology built in. Wireless printers can cost as little as $80\\\\. Some of the higher-priced printers (over $150+) even have a built-in Ethernet network port and fax capabilities.\\n\\nBut what if you are like me and just are not able to go out and purchase a new printer? Luckily, there are few different ways to take your current printer and sort of ‘convert’ it so that you can print to it wirelessly. Here are the different things you can do:\\n\\n* Purchase a Print Server. \\n\\nA Print Server is a tiny little device that connects your printer’s USB port. It converts the printer’s USB port into a wireless connection which connects to your home wireless network. After the wireless is set up, you open Devices and Printers on your Windows 7 computer, or Printers and Faxes on your Windows XP computer then search and connect to the printer.

Or do I\nneed to buy a new printer? I just went from PC to laptop.\n\nMy Answer: Ah, yes. Wireless. It is nice to have wireless freedom with a laptop\nisn’t it? You are not tied to a desk anymore if you want to go online or play a\ngame. But, the downside is that many printers (especially older printers) still\nrequire some type of physical cable or device in order to allow you to send\nprint jobs to a printer. How can we make it so that it is possible to print to\nan existing printer wirelessly?\n\nFirst off, almost all new printers have wireless capability and they are\nextremely easy to set up. All that you need is a wireless network at home\n(Chances are, if you have a laptop you already have a wireless router set up in\nyour home.) You can find wireless capable printers at any major retailer, such\nas Wal-Mart or Target, that has either Apple’s AirPrint or Google’s Cloud Print\ntechnology built in. Wireless printers can cost as little as $80. Some of the\nhigher-priced printers (over $150+) even have a built-in Ethernet network port\nand fax capabilities.\n\nBut what if you are like me and just are not able to go out and purchase a new\nprinter? Luckily, there are few different ways to take your current printer and\nsort of ‘convert’ it so that you can print to it wirelessly. Here are the\ndifferent things you can do:\n\n * Purchase a Print Server.\n\nA Print Server is a tiny little device that connects your printer’s USB port. It\nconverts the printer’s USB port into a wireless connection which connects to\nyour home wireless network. After the wireless is set up, you open Devices and\nPrinters on your Windows 7 computer, or Printers and Faxes on your Windows XP\ncomputer then search and connect to the printer. Here is a link from NewEgg.com\nthat has several different types of wireless print server devices at different\nprice points:\n\nhttp://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100007830%20600014429&IsNodeId=1&name=802.11b%20%2f%20g%2c%20RJ45\n[http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&N=100007830%20600014429&IsNodeId=1&name=802.11b%20%2f%20g%2c%20RJ45]\n\n * Share the printer on an existing computer.\n\nThis isn’t exactly a way to make the printer “wireless”, but it does allow you\nto print over a wireless network to  a computer that is already running.\nFortunately, this is pretty easy to do. Open open Devices and Printers on your\nWindows 7 computer, or Printers and Faxes on your Windows XP computer and\nright-click on the printer. Choose Printer Properties, then click on the Sharing\ntab to set up sharing. The problem with sharing a printer is that the computer\nthat is sharing the printer must be turned on and running. Printer sharing isn’t\nexactly a power-saving option, but at least it is an available option….\n\nSo that is pretty much it. As always, feel free to leave a comment.

It went a little something like this, “So this computer is five years old and it is running really slow. Any way you can make this computer run a bit faster? We don’t have any money in the budget to purchase a new computer…”. Yes, I did help the person out by performing a few steps to give the computer some ‘new life’ which I will talk about further down in this post. Not a week goes by where I don’t see or hear some type of TV commercial or online marketing ad, or magazine article with the heading “Speed up your computer!” or “How to get your computer running like it is brand new”. Everyone has their own ideas of how to get a computer running like it is brand new. In the end, they always suggest to buy or run some maintenance software which more often than not, does NOT help with improving the performance of the computer. Sometimes they recommend to buy hardware upgrades. But what actually works? How can you actually improve the performance of your computer without spending any money or installing additional software? Lets take a look at some of the things you can do that actually helps to speed up your computer again, shall we? \\n\\nThere is one thing the I need to address first. _Yes_, there is one (and I repeat, _only one_) thing that I recommend you spend money on to help increase performance in your computer, and that is to upgrade the memory in your computer\\\\laptop. \\n\\nAdding more RAM installed in your computer actually does increase performance in your computer. But is it worth the cost? It depends. If your computer is more than 5 years old I do not recommend that you purchase anything for it. You really should start looking for a new computer. The computer should support DDR2-type or DDR3-type memory. Anything older than that becomes too expensive to upgrade. Last, your computer should have at least 2GB installed. Unless you are doing some serious video editing or gaming, there is no real need of having more than 2GB of memory. Don’t spend the cash if you don’t need to. \\n\\n***I do not ever, EVER, recommend anyone to purchase software that claims to help speed up your computer (*cough* Norton Tools *cough*!) and I never, EVER, recommend that anyone go to a website that claims to speed up your computer because they are both a rip off (I am talking about you, …). \\nLets move on to talking about the stuff you can do to speed up your computer for free… \\n\\n**Number #1: Run the Disk Defragmenter at least once per month.** \\nThis single step takes care of a great deal of performance issues in almost every computer. To run Disk Defragmenter, click Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Disk Defragmenter. Let it run during a lunch break or overnight at least once per month. Also, make sure to run Disk Defragmenter AFTER you make any changes to the computer such as install a new program or delete a bunch of stuff. \\n\\n**Number #2: Set the Virtual Memory cache to “System Managed”.** \\nThis is something that is still a problem in Windows XP. Windows really _does_ know how to handle memory. But when a specific limit is placed on how Windows is allowed to manage the virtual memory, you can start seeing errors like “Not enough memory” or “Virtual Memory is too low”. By default, Windows XP and Windows 2000 sets the virtual memory limit to 1.5 times the amount of RAM installed in the computer (including virtual machines installations of Windows XP!), but Windows 7 automatically has virtual memory set to system managed. The process for making this change is the same in Windows 7 and Windows XP. To change this setting: \\n\\n* Click Start. Right click on “My Computer”, choose Properties.\\n* Click on the Advanced tab.\\n* Under Performance, click the “Settings” button.\\n* Click on the Advanced tab.\\n* Under Virtual Memory, click “Change” button.\\n* Make sure the C: volume is highlighted. Click “System Managed Size” bullet option, then click the “Set” button.\\n* Click OK. A warning appears onscreen to let you know to reboot the computer.\\n* Click OK to close the Performance Options window, then click OK to close the Computer Properties window. Reboot the computer when prompted.\\n\\n**Number #3: Clear out all of the junk data in %TEMP%.** \\nWhat is %TEMP%? This is the temporary files folder that Windows ‘dumps’ temp data into. FYI about Windows – Windows never cleans up the TEMP folder on its own. Over the years, it is possible to use up a lot of disk space with just temporary file data. It is a good idea to clean out this folder from time to time as some common programs rely on this folder to work. Also, old data can be too old or become corrupt and make a program run slower. To clean out the %TEMP% folder in all versions of Windows: \\n\\n* Click Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Command Prompt\\n* Type “%TEMP%” without quotes, hit enter.\\n* Windows Explorer will open in a new window displaying the temporary files folder. Delete all of the files you can in this folder, then empty the Recycle Bin. **Some files are locked. Don’t worry if you cannot delete all of the files.\\n\\n**Number #4: Remove programs from the computer that you do not use.** \\nGet rid of the software that you don’t use any more. This will help to clean up disk space, and may also remove some services from starting up when you boot the computer (there by increasing computer performance). If you bought a different printer, make sure that old printer software is removed. For example, you used to own an HP printer. Last year, you threw out that HP printer and bought a Lexmark printer but the HP printer software is still installed. Remove the HP software. The correct way of removing software from your computer is through the Control Panel. \\n\\n* In Windows XP, click Start > Control Panel. Change to “Classic View” in the left navigation bar and double-click on “Add\\\\Remove Programs”. Highlight a program from the list and choose “Change”, “Remove”, or “Uninstall” to go through the uninstall process for that particular program.\\n* In Windows 7, click Start > Control Panel. Under Programs, click on “Uninstall a program”. Highlight a program in the list and choose “Change”, “Remove”, or “Uninstall” to go through the uninstall process for that particular program.\\n\\n**Number #5: Remove all browser toolbars from the computer.** \\nThis includes the Bing Bar, Google Toolbar, Yahoo! Toolbar, etc. Toolbars make your web browser slower, which unfortunately is by design. Get rid of them to reclaim your browser speed! To remove a toolbar app, follow the same steps to remove an application in step #4. \\nNumber #6: Delete all cached data stored in your web browser. \\nAll web browsers save a copy of all website data in a folder on your computer as you visit a site. Browsers do this to attempt to speed up the browsing experience by not having to re-download the same data all the time. There is usually a limit set for how much data it will actually store on your computer, but most browsers do a terrible job of cleaning up the old data. Every once in a while, you should clear out the browser cache data on the computer. Doing this will make your web browsing experience faster. Deleting the cache data may also help resolve any issues you could be having, or have had at one point in time, with a particular web site (such as errors or other problems). To do this in your web browser, click on an appropriate link below: \\n\\n* [Internet Explorer](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260897)\\n* [Mozilla Firefox](http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/How%20to%20clear%20the%20cache)\\n* [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=95582)\\n\\n**Number #6: Remove entries from the Startup tab in the MSCONFIG tool.** \\nMSCONFIG is the System Configuration tool. You can disable services and other advanced things. The Startup tab is the most interesting feature because it displays all programs that run when you boot up the machine. You should remove any program from the list that you don’t use or don’t recognize as this will help to boot the machine faster, and not have a bunch of unknown programs run all the time. **WARNING: If you don’t know what the program name is, do a Google search first BEFORE removing the entry from the Startup tab.** To open the MSCONFIG tool: \\n\\n* Click Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Command Prompt.\\n* Type “c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\msconfig.exe” without quotes and hit enter.\\n* The System Configuration tool will appear onscreen. Click on the Startup tab and start looking at the program list.\\n\\n**Number #7: Make sure your antivirus software is set to run virus scans overnight, and actually let the scans run at that time!** \\nGo back and read one of my previous posts for a reason on why you should do this. I can’t leave any instructions on how to do this because of how many different anti-virus apps are out there. You will have to find out how to do this by yourself. Sorry… \\n\\n**Number #8: Keep your Software Up-to-date!** \\nRun Windows Updates, Microsoft Updates, Adobe Flash Player updates, Adobe Player updates, etc. This should be a given. Always make sure that you are running your computer and programs will the latest security and software updates. This makes sure your computer is as secure as it can be. Security updates also fix bugs and flaws, such as those that cause memory leaks (which eat up memory in your computer and can cause it to crash). \\n\\nSo, that concludes this extremely long post on how to speed up your computer. This is a pretty comprehensive list of some steps you can take to make your computer faster, as well as more secure and updated. Do you have more tips on how to speed up your computer?

To open the\nMSCONFIG tool:\n\n * Click Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Command Prompt.\n * Type “c:\\windows\\system32\\msconfig.exe” without quotes and hit enter.\n * The System Configuration tool will appear onscreen. Click on the Startup tab\n   and start looking at the program list.\n\nNumber #7: Make sure your antivirus software is set to run virus scans\novernight, and actually let the scans run at that time!\nGo back and read one of my previous posts for a reason on why you should do\nthis. I can’t leave any instructions on how to do this because of how many\ndifferent anti-virus apps are out there. You will have to find out how to do\nthis by yourself. Sorry…\n\nNumber #8: Keep your Software Up-to-date!\nRun Windows Updates, Microsoft Updates, Adobe Flash Player updates, Adobe Player\nupdates, etc. This should be a given. Always make sure that you are running your\ncomputer and programs will the latest security and software updates. This makes\nsure your computer is as secure as it can be. Security updates also fix bugs and\nflaws, such as those that cause memory leaks (which eat up memory in your\ncomputer and can cause it to crash).\n\nSo, that concludes this extremely long post on how to speed up your computer.\nThis is a pretty comprehensive list of some steps you can take to make your\ncomputer faster, as well as more secure and updated.

After doing an ipconfig /renew from the command line, I had Internet access. So what was going on with my modem?\\n\\nI live in Florida and my ISP is Bright House Networks. Bright house has their DHCP time to live assignments set to 8 hours for home customers in my area. How do I know this? Because I looked at the history logs in the modem. Also, performing an ipconfig /all displays the TTL and DHCP lease info in the command line. What does this mean and how does this answer my question about the connection drop outs?\\n\\nMy modem is set to drop it's ip address lease every 8 hours and request a new one from bright house's DHCP servers. It can take up to 4 minutes for the process to complete due to region and service load. Also, since bright house is a cable network, the bandwidth is shared with my neighbors and can cause additional delays (especially if the neighbor's cable modem is also trying to renew it's DHCP lease at the same time). When a computer, or modem or any internet connected device, does NOT have an IP address it means that it is not connected to any network whatsoever. This means no streaming music, no web browsing, and no internet access at all. Of course, once an ip address is assigned to the modem from my ISP, viola! Internet access is restored. This example is just in my own instance and others may not have these types of issues. But if you are a Comcast customer, their DHCP leases are even shorter (and even shorter still in heavily populated areas such as apartments or heavy urban areas like Downtown Seattle or Orlando). Why do ISPs have DHCP leases set for a very short period of time? Because there are no more IPv4 addresses left in the world and they are a very expensive commodity. At this time, because the world is still heavily reliant on IPv4 addressing, ISPs are forced to assign IPv4 addresses to both businesses and home customers. Obviously, businesses take priority while home customers are stuck with the leftovers. IPv6 fixes this problem...\\n\\nSo, this completely answers my question about why my Internet connection drops out from time to time. So why did you read this entire post and why should you care? Because this issue happens to everyone regardless of their ISP or type of service! I remembered at my place of work that we work on issues from time to time with our customers where their Internet connection dropped out during a web conferencing recording session, then after a few minutes everything was working again but the recording session was broken or missing. Or that the one of our branch offices has intermittent network drop-outs during the day at random times (some of our branch offices have Comcast as their ISP provider), or that a customer loses internet connection at a specific time per day but then everything works fine after a few minutes. **There is a way to check a modem's DHCP lease time by logging directly into the modem and looking at the logs.... look for 'time to live' or 'lease time'...\\n\\nSo the final question would be, \\\"is there a way to make it so that there are no network drop-outs due to DHCP renewals?\\\" .... No. This is simply the way that TCP/IP networks are designed at this time. Unless ISPs decide to change their policies regarding their DHCP server settings, the answer will forever be NO. But like I said, IPv6 fixes this problem. With IPv6, there is an almost infinite number of IP addresses that can be assigned (in the trillions!) to thousands of devices and there may not be a need to use DHCP with IPv6 (no refreshing IP addresses, no needing to recycle IP addresses, and so on). Unfortunately, full IPv6 worldwide implementation is still years away. For now, we will just have to deal with what the ISPs provide us with.\\n\\nSo lets say that you call your ISP and try to explain this issue to them. You are really just wasting your time. Hang up now and just wait for everything to work again. The 1st level technician on the line most likely will not know anything about what I have just written about, and you trying to explain this problem to them will go in one ear and out the other. Just don’t bother with the ISP. If you need a persistent internet connection, then open your checkbook and pay for a dedicated internet line (such as a T1) with a static IP address. But if you do this, be prepared to shell out a good percentage of your cash per month because these types of lines are expensive (which should not come as a surprise to you). Otherwise, you are stuck with the generic DHCP pool just like the rest of the world.\\n\\n- Joe\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I was sitting at my desk last night doing my college homework and listening to <img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jIPNvBuH41s/TPZ0sK6rv6I/AAAAAAAAFwE/ySH6IfEVDQM/s1600/internet-down.jpg\" alt=\"\">streaming music (yay for <a href=\"http://www.spotify.com\">Spotify</a></p>\n<p>I connected my desktop PC directly to the modem and reset it.

When a computer, or modem or any internet connected device, does NOT have an IP address it means that it is not connected to any network whatsoever. This means no streaming music, no web browsing, and no internet access at all. Of course, once an ip address is assigned to the modem from my ISP, viola! Internet access is restored. This example is just in my own instance and others may not have these types of issues. But if you are a Comcast customer, their DHCP leases are even shorter (and even shorter still in heavily populated areas such as apartments or heavy urban areas like Downtown Seattle or Orlando). Why do ISPs have DHCP leases set for a very short period of time? Because there are no more IPv4 addresses left in the world and they are a very expensive commodity.

I remembered at my place of work that we work on issues from time to time with our customers where their Internet connection dropped out during a web conferencing recording session, then after a few minutes everything was working again but the recording session was broken or missing. Or that the one of our branch offices has intermittent network drop-outs during the day at random times (some of our branch offices have Comcast as their ISP provider), or that a customer loses internet connection at a specific time per day but then everything works fine after a few minutes. **There is a way to check a modem's DHCP lease time by logging directly into the modem and looking at the logs.... look for 'time to live' or 'lease time'...</p>\n<p>So the final question would be, &quot;is there a way to make it so that there are no network drop-outs due to DHCP renewals?&quot; .... No. This is simply the way that TCP/IP networks are designed at this time. Unless ISPs decide to change their policies regarding their DHCP server settings, the answer will forever be NO. But like I said, IPv6 fixes this problem. With IPv6, there is an almost infinite number of IP addresses that can be assigned (in the trillions!) to thousands of devices and there may not be a need to use DHCP with IPv6 (no refreshing IP addresses, no needing to recycle IP addresses, and so on).

Over the weekend, a good friend came to me asking\nif I could help him with his Acer laptop. He was attempting to perform a system\nrestore using the built in Acer support tools. The laptop re-installed Windows 7\nand rebooted. But for some reason there was a problem; first time setup kept\nfailing at the installing devices screen. An error appeared saying “Windows\ncould not complete setup. Please restart and try again.” (or something like\nthat). He would restart the computer but the error would come up again.\nBasically, the Windows install was toast. The error would never go away and\nthere was nothing he could do. Windows refused to boot into safe mode as well\nbecause first time setup had not finished on the re-imaged laptop. Even worse\nwas that my friend didn’t burn the DVD restore discs after he turned on the\nlaptop for the first time when it actually was  working. What was I to do to get\nthis laptop working again?\n\nI started looking around the hard disk using Explorer in my MS DaRT USB disk and\nfound that the PQRECOVERY partition was still intact. The partition was around\n10GB in size and was readable. Since the recovery partition was still there, I\ncould copy the entire partition as-is to a bootable WinPE USB drive and perform\na system restore! Here is how I did it…..\n\n 1. Create a bootable WinPE disk drive. ** The easiest way to do this is to\n    follow the instructions to create a bootable Windows 7 installation USB\n    drive. Instructions are located or here\n    [http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-install-windows-7vista-from-usb-drive-detailed-100-working-guide/]\n    \n    \n 2. Copy the entire recovery partition as-is to the bootable WinPE disk drive.\n    ** This can be done several different ways. One way is to remove the hard\n    drive from the computer and use a USB dongle to copy the data on another\n    computer. Or, use some type of boot disc (such as a Linux LiveCD or MS DaRT\n    tools CD) to be able to copy the data manually to the WinPE boot disc.\n    \n    \n 3. Boot the PC with your WinPE disc drive and perform the system restore.\n    \n    \n\nThats it! This worked just fine for me on an Acer laptop. I would expect to get\nthe same results from a different vendor such as HP or Dell, but all vendors\nhandle system recovery partitions in a different manner. As long as that\nrecovery partition is some type of WinPE 3.0 environment, these instructions\nshould work for you.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2011-08-31T16:27:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2011-08-31T16:27:49.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2011-08-31T16:27:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdcc94","uuid":"df7ebeec-30cc-4120-b003-3e2c6fcbaea9","title":"Install an MDT Application based on Model and Network or Media Distribution Point","slug":"install_an_mdt_application_based_on_model_and_network_or_media_distribution_point-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I ran into a little problem while with trying to install an application inside of my Microsoft Deployment Toolkit 2010 distribution share.

Also, I need to make sure the install script will run on Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7\\\\.\\n\\nBecause of the variety of applications that I must have in my environment in addition to the variety of desktop OSes, I choose to use batch files. I could have used VBScript, but for me batch files are easier to work with and easier to change on the fly. Plus the command line window that displays onscreen at least lets me _know_ that there _is_ something happening on the computer. What I needed to do was find out how to customize the install script to find out what version of Windows installed then only execute the installation process if the version is Windows XP. If the version of Windows installed didn’t match, then go to the end of the batch file where it terminates via EXIT.\\n\\nTo my surprise, this was quite easy to do.

If the version has “XP” in the string, then go to the label “INSTALL” where the actual script work is located. If the version has “7600” in the string then go to the label “GOODBYE” where the batch file terminates. This works great in Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7 computers.\\n\\nThe script can be edited to do the opposite. Install the application if it is Windows 7 and not Windows XP, and so on. This script can also be edited so that it executes a command, or set of commands, instead of executing a software install.\\n\\nOf course, there may be a better way to go about scripting the install, such as Powershell, but this is my own solution.

If you have an MCSE in Windows 2000 it just doesn’t cut it any longer. You need to upgrade and keep your certifications current in addition to keeping up with current technology. I hope to arm you with some important, critical, information about what certification paths to take and how to obtain your goals. \\n** DISCLAIMER: This article is of my own opinion after 4 years of working in various IT outfits. I am just explaining things as I see it. If you are looking for IT Developer info, this article is not for you. Also, I am not going to talk one bit about IT management or specialized roles such as Exchange administrator or Datacenter Engineer. This article is all about the general stuff. If you are looking to break into an IT support career and continue to move up through the low-end (helpdesk) jobs to a more advanced position, then keep reading. \\nFrom what I have seen so far, there are 4 primary support-type positions in IT and 3 different primary professions to choose from. \\nTechnical Support Role #1 – Helpdesk, Service Desk and Desktop Support \\nTechnical Support Role #2 – Network Administration and Engineering \\nTechnical Support Role #3 – Server Administration and Engineering \\nTechnical Support Role #4 – Security Administration and Engineering \\nProfessional Career Track #1 – Network \\nProfessional Career Track #2 – Server \\nProfessional Career Track #3 – Security \\nStarting with #1, the helpdesk. This is your entry-level, tier 1, position and is a very good place to start your career. Helpdesk people are the ‘lackeys’, or the ones that do most of the grunt work. You learn many things in the helpdesk especially professionalism and customer service skills that are lacking in the IT industry. The cool thing about working on the helpdesk is that you get to dabble in several different areas of IT. Also, a very good thing about working the helpdesk is that you get to see how the business is managed. If you are very good on the helpdesk it is possible to upgrade to Desktop Support, which is a tier 2 position. Beyond Desktop Support, there is not much to move into without more schooling or certification. Helpdesk jobs are a dime a dozen. They are not hard to find. The bad thing about the helpdesk is that it has a very high turnover rate. Count on having at least 3 different helpdesk jobs at 3 different companies within a 5 year period. This will help gain you more experience, help you find a business that you would like to grow with, and help you make a decision on what IT career track you want to take – Network, Server, or Security Administration. \\nSome popular Certifications with this Technical Support Role: \\n\\nSome popular advanced certifications with this Technical Support Role: \\n\\nNumber 2, Network Administrator. A network administrator deals strictly with support-type issues related to, you guessed it, networking. This may or may not include working with the helpdesk, supporting and administering network devices, configuring routers and switches, dealing with IP telephony, and so on. There is not much ‘advancing’ in Network Administration. When you become a Netadmin, that is pretty much it. The reason is because most businesses consider Network Administration and Network Engineering the EXACT same thing. And if you have not already figured it out yet, networks don’t really change as dramatically as desktops or servers – that is unless you work for a telecom company. Don’t get me wrong though, Network Administration is a VERY lucrative and VERY profitable career. Just keep in mind that there is not much change with networks. Many netadmins start out on the helpdesk. When working the helpdesk they complete their schooling and get certified, then find some type of networking job. So sometimes there is some job hopping involved. The good news is that there are usually a good amount of Network Administrator jobs out there. The bad thing is that netadmin jobs tend to be short-term (think contract jobs) or have a medium turnover rate. Also, netadmins have to constantly get re-certified in the same technology just to stay current. It doesn’t matter if the technology has not changed, you just need to re-certify because most network certifications expire after 3 years. Becoming a certified network administrator guarantees marketability. If networking is “Your bag, baby!!!” then this is the career for you. \\nSome popular Certifications with this Technical Support Role: \\n\\nServer Administration and Engineering. Dealing with Servers is a very fun and very challenging task. In order to become a Server admin, experience is the key. You will need to have a huge amount of knowledge on the PC desktop, knowledge on a variety of PC and server hardware, knowledge of vendor specific server applications, virtualization, security, advanced or expert networking skills (possibly more than a Network Administrator would know), and business knowledge. It just is not possible to shoot straight into a Server admin role without proving your skills first. Usually, Server Admins are seasoned veterans of the IT profession and have a great deal of knowledge in almost every aspect of server, desktop, network, and IT security. Server Admins tend to be the ‘go to’ people, which makes them incredibly valuable – albeit expensive as well (which can be a burden on a company’s IT budget). It tends to be difficult to become a Server Admin. Usually you start at the helpdesk, then get promoted to Desktop Support. While in Desktop Support, you will obtain server certifications and continue to train or go back to college to get your B.A while you sit and wait for a Server Admin position to open up, which could take years. So like I said, it is very difficult to become a Server Admin. The only career path above a Server admin is getting into upper IT management. But if this is the career for you, don’t give up! The rewards far outweigh the heartache and pain in getting to this point. \\nSome popular Certifications with this Technical Support Role: \\n\\nSecurity Administrator keeps on flipping back and forth with network administration between the highest, or 2nd highest most sought after IT jobs in the world. I am not going to lie, I do not know much about Security Administration. But I do know that it is VERY high in demand. Count on performing a great deal of auditing and providing reports to management as a Security Administrator or IT Auditor. Sometimes, being having hacking skills help obtain a security-type position. Having a high-level of knowledge of networking or server engineering is not necessarily required to be a security administrator, but you DO need to know how networks and servers can be broken (security-related of course). Many people in the Security Administrator role jumped into these positions right after college, or after working as a Junior Network administrator or Junior Server administrator. Security is still a misunderstood area of IT that businesses tend to fall short on. If you choose this profession, it is possible to skyrocket into IT management very quickly. \\nSome popular Certifications with this Technical Support Role: \\n\\n[More information on the different IT security certifications](http://certification.about.com/od/securitycerts/a/seccertessentls.htm)\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Lets face it.

If you know how things work you can better determine the cause of a problem or get things up and running much quicker. Lets say you are troubleshooting a problem on a computer for a user. They are having an issue with an application that no one else is using, no one else knows anything about, and no one else has any information on. What do you do in this case? Well, one of the things that is a great start is finding out how it works. Starting here is perfect and leads you to more obvious questions such as “How is the program installed?”, “How is the program used?”, or even “Is this the latest version of the program?”. As you can see, finding out how something actually works is often completely overlooked by many tech support personnel when they are stumped on an issue.

Research is the heart of troubleshooting in general. If you do not know how to fix a problem, or don’t know how something works, you need to research and find out on your own. In my opinion, those that do not wish to research simply do not care or do not wish to learn and expand their knowledge. This is a dangerous situation to have especially in the tech support area as it displays carelessness and laziness. Knowledge is key. Always remember that “Google is your friend”. \\n**<u>Secret #3 – Share the knowledge.</u>** Sharing knowledge is key in the tech support business. A common belief amongst tech support people is that if they hold the knowledge in their heads, it increases their job security because they are the only ones that knows the info. But withholding knowledge hurts everyone including your co-workers, the users you support, and even the business you support. Think of it this way, what if internet search engines never existed? What if Google said, “Oh, well I know this information but I don’t want to share it.” It would be almost impossible to find information quickly and efficiently wouldn’t it? The internet would almost cease to exist without search engines. Sharing knowledge helps improve some of your basic communication and writing skills and can even help to improve your work ethic and credibility as a tech support employee.

Select your USB drive, check the box to format the drive, highlight\n    “MemTest86+”, check the box to download the ISO, then click the “Create”\n    button (screenshot of the options you need to make is below):\n\n \n[http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wrT9VW078bU/TICML10j--I/AAAAAAAAATA/w4O-CnTvtRc/s1600-h/image%5B9%5D.png]\n4. When the program has complete, click Next, then NO if asked to add more\ndistros. Click Finish to close the program.\n5. Navigate to the root of the USB disk in Windows Explorer (you will notice\nthat the volume name is “MULTIBOOT”).\n6. Copy the VMWare ESXi ISO file directly to the root of the multiboot USB\ndrive.\n7. Rename the ISO to “VMWARE40.ISO”.\n8. Open the MENU.LST file in a text editor.\n9. Paste this text EXACTLY as it is shown below at the end of the file and save\nit:\n\n_**title VMWare\n\nfind --set-root /vmware40.iso\n\nmap --mem /vmware40.iso (hd32)\n\nmap --hook\n\nroot (hd32)\n\nchainloader (hd32)**_\n10. Safely remove the USB drive from the Windows computer.\n11. Boot your target computer from the newly created USB drive.\n12. At the boot menu, select VMWare and wait a moment.\n13. The VMWare installation menu will appear.\n14. Done.\n\nSo what happened after the computer boots to the USB drive? A menu displayed\nwith the bootable ISOs in the list. At this time there are 2. One is the MemTest\ntool, the other is VMWare. You chose the VMWare selection and hit enter. The\nbootloader created a temporary RAM drive, copied the ISO file to the RAM drive,\nthen booted the ISO directly from RAM. Since the entire ISO image is loaded\ndirectly into RAM, you will notice that the VMWare installation completes\nextremely fast. When the computer reboots, the RAM drive is lost and proceeds to\nboot ESX normally. Pretty slick, huh?\n[http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wrT9VW078bU/TICML10j--I/AAAAAAAAAS0/fDQVwzVbDHE/s1600-h/image%5B7%5D.png]","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2010-09-03T05:48:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2011-08-29T14:17:23.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2010-09-03T05:48:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdccb3","uuid":"508a4ecd-b4e8-4885-8664-279d4a1eae83","title":"Converting old Windows XP Ghost images to Microsoft Deployment Services or Microsoft Deployment Toolkit","slug":"converting_old_windows_xp_ghost_images_to_microsoft_deployment_services_or_microsoft_deployment_toolkit-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"****Special Note: Please keep in mind that this article does not explain how to prepare or configure your network environment for imaging.

Congratulations! But, why on Earth![](http://hasqwq.blu.livefilestore.com/y1p8RheWGV5xWXwj2Pkf2ZPQUgbBFUI5pR9eOTLDT_W7q4lQRaftE2-W1_2xIhsa1vAyAT1xJSN430M5_EhZHlorqTisefY8ZKz/MDT-wheel.jpg) would you want to convert your old images and dump it into the new solution? Also, how do you take your current images and add them into Windows Deployment Services or the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit? \\n\\nThe primary reason why you would want to keep your old images is for archive and reference reasons. Also, maybe you require more than one image per hardware model or employee role. Whatever the reason, you know that you just need to keep your images. \\n\\nAnother reason to move to the new WIM image format is because of how GHO images are built. GHO images are sector based, while WIM images are file based which allows you to shrink captured images by up to 80%. WIM images also allow you to service the images offline; GHO images do not (at least not easily…).With WIM images, it is easier to service the images offline instead of being forced to recapture the image all over again. Think of a WIM like a large ZIP file.  You can unpack a ZIP file, change or add or remove a few things, then repackage the ZIP file all in one sitting. Now think of GHO images like an EXE file. You can’t edit the EXE’s contents and if you could, you can’t do it easily. The EXE file needs to be recreated all over again. The WIM format makes it easier to service images without having to go through an entire process to make a simple or small change. And did I mention that the Microsoft tools are free while Symantec’s software is not? Think about it :) \\n\\nNow, there are several requirements in order to capture a WIM image. First, the computer must be prepared using the System Preparation Tool (sysprep) and must be in a shutdown state. No reboots after sysprep has been executed or you will need to run sysprep again. Make sure the computer is 100% turned off. If you prepared your Ghost images correctly, your deployment images should already be sysprepped. Second, you need to boot the computer into the WinPE environment. You can do this by setting up a Windows Deployment Services server and configuring PXEBOOT options, or you can build a bootable ISO using the Windows AIK, or you can use the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit to build a deployment share and create bootable ISO images and PXEBOOT network images. And finally, you can only capture WIM images for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2008 operating systems. \\n\\nI will explain the general steps that I took in order to convert my current Ghost images to WIM: \\n\\n1. Deploy one of your Ghost images to a computer. When imaging is complete power off the computer. Do not reboot and do not allow the computer to boot into Windows. \\n\\nSo what have we done here? We simply deployed one of the sysprepped GHO images to the hard drive of a target computer. We have also NOT rebooted this computer. It is turned off. Why only turn it off? Because after first boot, Windows will apply the settings defined from running the System Preparation Tool (called Mini-Setup) and boot into Windows for the first time. Because capturing a WIM image requires that the computer has been sysprepped and must be in an unused state, we must leave the computer turned off. \\n\\n**If your Ghost images are not sysprepped, this is not a problem. Simply deploy the Ghost image, boot the computer into Windows for the first time, run sysprep and shut the computer down.\\n2. Turn on the computer and immediately boot into your WinPE boot environment without allowing Windows XP to boot for the first time. \\n\\nAgain, what is the purpose of this? Doesn't booting the computer allow mini-setup to run? No it does not. See, we are not booting the computer to the hard drive that has the Windows image on it. We are booting the computer into the WinPE environment bypassing the hard disk boot. This leaves the hard disk in an unused state, which is a requirement to capture a WIM image.\\n3. Capture the image in WinPE and store it in your imaging solution. \\n\\nNow, while inside of WinPE we can now capture the image using ImageX, or Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, or Windows Deployment Services. It all depends on how you have your imaging environment set up. I like to use a Windows 7 Capture Image that I created in Windows Deployment Services, boot to the network, and select the Capture Image from the network boot menu. The Capture Image is a customized boot image that does only one job; Boot into WinPE and launch the Capture Image tool. Like I said in my disclaimer at the top of this article, I cannot tell you how to prepare your environment for imaging. But if you contact me via email (joe@joedissmeyer.com), I would be happy to help you out.\\n4. Done.\\n\\nWell that sounds easy, right?! Maybe a little, but most of it should not. This is just a simple overview of the process. It is truly up to you to understand exactly what is going on during and after the entire deployment process.

This would include any automatic updates from\n    Microsoft, Adobe, Java, etc.\n    \n    \n 2. Do not install or change any files on the computer until the computer is\n    100% encrypted. What I mean is don’t start installing a large program such\n    as Microsoft SQL Server on a computer that is in the middle of encrypting\n    unless you want problems to occur.\n    \n    \n 3. Allow the computer to finish encrypting before deployment. You may not be\n    able to follow this step, but you get the point…\n    \n    \n\nI hope you all learn from my mistakes and follow the simple guidelines above.\nGood luck with your encryption solutions!","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2010-08-19T02:45:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2011-08-29T14:17:23.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2010-08-19T02:45:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdccb5","uuid":"fcdb36d3-659f-4cdd-b630-369ba8f4c1dd","title":"Manage your iPod with free iTunes alternatives","slug":"manage_your_i_pod_with_free_i_tunes_alternatives-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"iTunes stinks to high heaven.

I used a remote tool to take control of his windows session and I added the website as a trusted site in the Internet Sites list. Even though I did that, IE still asked for credentials. So instead, I added the site as a trusted Intranet (not Internet) site, which IE prompted me that if I wanted to continue it would move the site to the intranet sites from the trusted internet sites. Obviously I clicked OK. Now that the intranet site opens just fine they tried to open a Word doc hosted on the page, but when opening the document, Microsoft Word 2007 was demanding credentials to view the file! The user made the changes he wanted then saved, but Word 2007 again asked to save the file. That is 3 logins just to do his work! Not worrying about the Word 2007 login annoyance, I continued looking at the problems this user was experiencing. Now the user wanted to go to another intranet site such as site2.contoso.local, IE prompted for credentials again. Instead of adding site2.contoso.local I attempted to add the domain by defining \\\"[http://*.contoso.local\\\"](http://*.contoso.local\\\")\\n\\nMicrosoft changed their entire security model regarding Trusted Internet Sites and Intranet Sites for Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 and Office 2007\\\\. If the website as a 'dot' in it, meaning Microsoft.com or Contoso.local, the browser will not pass credentials to the web server automatically because it believes that this is an internet website, not an intranet hosted site. In Office 2007 applications, there is a feature called the \\\"Trust Center\\\" that does the EXACT SAME thing that Internet Explorer does. Adding the website as a trusted intranet site solves the problem, but only for that one website. I needed to add the additional websites so the user wasn't constantly probed for credentials.\\n\\nThere are 2 fixes to this problem: \\nOption #1 is to simply add the sites manually as intranet sites in Internet Explorer, and add the sites as intranet sites in the Trust Center in Office 2007 applications. Option #2, just make a friendly DNS alias per site; for example \\\"site1\\\" that points to \\\"site1.contoso.local\\\" or \\\"site2\\\" that points to \\\"site2.contoso.local\\\". Option 2 was the best course of action because of the level of impact that this issue could have. But as we all know, even if a little change is the best course of action System and Network Admins don't like change – especially if the change recommendation comes from level one support.

Solution two is to upgrade Group Policy ADM and ADMX files for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 support on the domain controllers then modify both User and Computer Point and Print Restrictions to allow for users to install print drivers.

Support calls flow\ninto the helpdesk or Service Desk primarily due to a lack of planning. And\nplanning, ladies and gentleman, SHOULD BE your primary concern when expecting to\nimplement new technology in the corporate environment. Now, of course, I don't\nintend to generalize my ideas on every single admin because I KNOW my statements\nto not apply to every single one of them. But in my experience, 90% of the\nadmins I have had to deal with have this mentality, which I do not appreciate.\nAnyways, on with the point of my post....\n\nWith new versions of software, especially in Microsoft's case, the software\ndeveloper usually makes changes to how the software works, or how security\nfunctions in the new software, and brings new compatibility issues with current\nclient or server designs. Cases in point, Internet Explorer 7 and 8, Office\n2007, and Windows 7.\n\nProblem #1: I received a phone call from a user that is getting annoyed with\nInternet Explorer 8 on their Windows 7 computer because it keeps on asking for\nhis user credentials even though it is an intranet site (for this example lets\nsay the site is site1.contoso.local). I used a remote tool to take control of\nhis windows session and I added the website as a trusted site in the Internet\nSites list. Even though I did that, IE still asked for credentials. So instead,\nI added the site as a trusted Intranet (not Internet) site, which IE prompted me\nthat if I wanted to continue it would move the site to the intranet sites from\nthe trusted internet sites. Obviously I clicked OK. Now that the intranet site\nopens just fine they tried to open a Word doc hosted on the page, but when\nopening the document, Microsoft Word 2007 was demanding credentials to view the\nfile! The user made the changes he wanted then saved, but Word 2007 again asked\nto save the file. That is 3 logins just to do his work! Not worrying about the\nWord 2007 login annoyance, I continued looking at the problems this user was\nexperiencing. Now the user wanted to go to another intranet site such as\nsite2.contoso.local, IE prompted for credentials again. Instead of adding\nsite2.contoso.local I attempted to add the domain by defining \"\nhttp://*.contoso.local\" [http://*.contoso.local%22]\n\nMicrosoft changed their entire security model regarding Trusted Internet Sites\nand Intranet Sites for Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 and Office\n2007. If the website as a 'dot' in it, meaning Microsoft.com or Contoso.local,\nthe browser will not pass credentials to the web server automatically because it\nbelieves that this is an internet website, not an intranet hosted site. In\nOffice 2007 applications, there is a feature called the \"Trust Center\" that does\nthe EXACT SAME thing that Internet Explorer does. Adding the website as a\ntrusted intranet site solves the problem, but only for that one website. I\nneeded to add the additional websites so the user wasn't constantly probed for\ncredentials.\n\nThere are 2 fixes to this problem:\nOption #1 is to simply add the sites manually as intranet sites in Internet\nExplorer, and add the sites as intranet sites in the Trust Center in Office 2007\napplications. Option #2, just make a friendly DNS alias per site; for example\n\"site1\" that points to \"site1.contoso.local\" or \"site2\" that points to\n\"site2.contoso.local\". Option 2 was the best course of action because of the\nlevel of impact that this issue could have. But as we all know, even if a little\nchange is the best course of action System and Network Admins don't like change\n– especially if the change recommendation comes from level one support. The\nadmins didn't bother looking into the issue until they experienced the same\nissue on their own.\n\nProblem #2:\nUser calls the Service Desk and asks to map a network printer on her Windows 7\ncomputer. I remote into her Windows session to help. I searched for the network\nprinter and added it, but Windows stopped the driver installation and said that\nonly Administrators can install drivers on the computer. The user had a windows\nXP computer last week and they were able to add printers at any time. What is\ngoing on and how can I fix it?\n\nSolution one is to use the Windows 7 \"switch user\" feature and log in with admin\nrights, then map the same printer on your own which will install the driver on\nthe computer. Log off of the computer, have the  and allow the user to map the\nprinter when they log in themselves. Solution two is to upgrade Group Policy ADM\nand ADMX files for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 support on the domain\ncontrollers then modify both User and Computer Point and Print Restrictions to\nallow for users to install print drivers. Solution one is a workaround, solution\ntwo is the permanent fix.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2010-06-07T19:01:00.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2011-08-29T14:17:23.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2010-06-07T19:01:00.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdccb9","uuid":"56cd3bf8-1810-4861-8e2a-8075324d9bad","title":"Screenpresso – The Free Alternative for SnagIT and the Snipping Tool","slug":"screenpresso_the_free_alternative_for_snag_it_and_the_snipping_tool-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"There are a ton of reasons as to why one would need to take a screenshot of their computer screen.

Luckily I have compiled a short list of things to check out on your own. They are divided in three sections: \\nResources, Integrated Development Environments, and Source Control.\\n\\n**<u>Resources:</u>**\\n\\nEveryone needs to start learning somewhere. Thankfully, Microsoft has created an excellent beginner’s site, the [MSDN Beginner Developer Learning Center](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/beginner/default.aspx)\\n\\nis another great resource. Dev Shed caters towards open source tools and links to other open source programming[![image](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_wrT9VW078bU/S-zNJL5JftI/AAAAAAAAARI/8iZVt2CgdOE/image%5B8%5D.png?imgmax=800 \\\"image\\\")](http://www.devshed.com/)\\n\\nIf you need books, look no further than ! Google has been digitizing a huge amount of books available online – and almost  all of them are available for FREE! Forget about your local library, use [Google Books](http://www.google.com/books)\\n\\n**<u>Integrated Development Environments (IDE):</u>**\\n\\nThe IDE is the heart and soul of your programming experience and is where you, as a programmer, will spend most all of your time developing and testing your programs. The IDE is your visual source code editor, compiler or interpreter, build tools, and debugger all in one environment – hence is why it is called an Integrated Development Environment!\\n\\nIf you are looking to get started with some entry level programming using languages such as Visual Basic, VB.NET, C++, C#, plus a bunch of other languages and project types then [Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Express](http://www.microsoft.com/express/downloads/)\\n\\nJava is the most popular programming language in the world and Java programmers are the most in-demand in the programming job market. A fantastic IDE for Java is and works on all three types of operating systems, Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux. New releases of come out quite often and provide more features than the last edition. The current version of [NetBeans](http://www.netbeans.com/)\\n\\n**<u>Source Control, Storage, and Sharing:</u>**\\n\\nSo now that you have an IDE and references to start programming, what are you going to do about managing your source code? Managing source code may be a bit too advanced for the beginner, but if you start to develop an advanced program you need to manage certain aspects of the app lifecycle.

It is using us.\\n\\nIn the beginning, social media as a platform was an amazing thing. In the first days of MySpace, Friendster, Twitter, or Facebook (the list goes on) it brought people together. It made it possible to re-connect with family members that seemed to have been forgotten. It allowed you to connect with friends or co-workers from long ago. And it helped to bring some people together that you never would have thought shared the same values or ideas. This in itself is an amazing thing!\\n\\nIn the beginning, social media platforms brought people together.\\n\\nAnd very quickly, it became the new \\\"public square\\\". \\n\\nSocial media was optimistic, democratic, civil, and it allowed people to be somewhat anonymous. It was considered a \\\"safe place\\\" to share your thoughts, opinions, disappointments, wins or losses. It was simple and possible to share life experiences and ideas in an assumed *safe place* with others that shared the same values as you did.\\n\\nBut over time something happened. Something changed for the worse.\\n\\nThe controversial issues started to be discussed openly in the public square. And in the beginning it wasn't a big deal.\\nIn the beginning there was this universal understanding that if one had a disagreement with a topic that it was ok to simply disagree, move on, and discuss topics that they did share the same values with.\\n\\nBut over time, those that were originally open to having honest and civil discussions about these topics started getting responses from those that disagreed.\\nAnd very quickly those responses started to get dark.\\nThose that simply disagreed on opposing points of view quickly started to move past the point of deadlock, and the attacks started.\\n\\nAt first, the attacks were subtle and individual.\\nBut then the attacks escalated to entire groups and sub-cultures.\\nThen after the attacks came the public shaming.\\nThen after the shaming came the trolls, with the goal of complete annihilation.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nIsn't it interesting that we all inherently *know* that it is not possible for anyone else to be EXACTLY like us?\\nAnd that every person on this planet, both young and old, through their own personal experience encounter many others that do not have the same ideas that they do?\\n\\nWe all KNOW that it is not possible for someone else to be EXACTLY like us. \\n\\nWe all KNOW that people do NOT think exactly the way that we do, nor in the way that we do. \\n\\nWe all KNOW that everyone has their own individual way of learning, their own individual way of thinking, their own individual way of logic, and their own unique formed worldview.\\n\\nBut when we discover that someone else thinks differently than us, we are taken aback and are absolutely stunned by it.\\n\\nWhen it comes to controversial topics (i.e. marriage, abortion, faith) somehow most of us begin to convince ourselves that it is our job to convert them to our point of view. That, \\\"By any means necessary these people must see the light! They need to be rescued from the dark side!\\\" We convince ourselves that ONLY we are the rational ones and those that have a difference of opinion are *absolutely* irrational.\\n\\nBut we don't call them irrational.\\n\\nWith those that we are unable to convert to our way of thinking, or for those that we cannot seem to 'get on our side', we start making accusations. We try to break them down by attacking their humanity. The name calling starts and escalates quickly.\\n\\nWe call them stupid.\\n\\nWe call them despicable.\\n\\nWe call them racist.\\n\\nWe call them retarded.\\n\\nWe call them crazy.\\n\\nThen we call them insane.\\n\\nFor some reason, over time we convince ourselves that people with whom we have an impasse with need to be shamed out of existence. We convince ourselves that these people, simply because they are different than ourselves, need to be destroyed.\\n\\nAnd we justify all of this in the name of \\\"social justice\\\".\\n\\nBut is this really justice?\\nIs this really democratic?\\nDoes this behavior truly help our cause and goal?\\n\\nI think not.\\n\\nIt is a very human thing to de-humanize the people we hurt.\\nWe want to destroy people and not feel bad about it.\\n\\nSome of us think that our hurtful communication towards another individual or group over social media is justified.\\n\\nCommunication is one of the social aspects of being human.\\n\\nHumans are all designed for social activity and we cannot survive without being social. Everything us humans do is social.\\n\\nWe decieve ourselves into believing that social media feeds our social needs as humans. That somehow, life happens on social media so we need to be connected as much as possible.\\n\\nThis couldn't be more false.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nSocial media, to put it plainly, is *addictive*.\\n\\nIt is engineered to be addictive.\\nIt is engineered to be as habit-forming as crystal meth.\\nIt is engineered to try to *make* you rely on it to survive.\\n\\nDo you not believe me? Do you not believe that social media is engineered to be addictive?\\n\\nHere is one example.\\n\\nWatch this CNET interview between Jerry Seinfeld and Mark Zuckerberg (start at 1:17).... https://youtu.be/ZFZWae4bmIw?t=1m17s\\n\\nThis is a fascinating interview!\\n\\nJerry asks Mark what the first thing that Mark does in the morning right after he wakes up. Mark answers, \\\"I check my phone.\\\" But he only uses the restroom only AFTER checking his phone.\\n\\n- If you you wake up in the morning and the *very first thing you do* is check your phone, you are addicted.\\n- If you walk all over your house room to room with your phone in your pocket, you are addicted.\\n- If you are out with your friends and you are texting someone not in your group, you are addicted.\\n- If you text WHILE you are driving your car, you are addicted.\\n- If you are with your spouse on the couch and you are texting them while they are *SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU*, you are addicted.\\n\\nScience has proven time and time again that for those whom are addicted to something, that when difficulties happen, and when significant stress happens in their lives, instead of turning to a person they turn to their addiction to cope.\\n\\nIn the case of social media addicts, when stress occurs, these addicts turn to a device, they turn to Facebook or Twitter. All of which offers only temporary relief.\\n\\n**Addictions are NOT a good thing.**\\n\\nAccording to the Marriam-Webster dictionary, the definition of [addiction](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/addicted) is \\\"strongly inclined or compelled to do, use, or indulge in something repeatedly\\\".\\n\\nAddictions are incredibly negative things in our lives. \\n\\nLike all addictions, in time it will destroy relationships, it will cost time, it will cost money, and it will make your life *worse*.\\n\\n---\\n\\nBut why stop here?\\n\\nScience has proved, and *continues* to prove, that those who spend more and more time on social media face higher rates of depression than people that spend less time on it.\\n\\nDo a simple web search \\\"facebook and depression\\\". You *might* notice that the headlines are from reputable sources....\\n\\n\\\"New study links Facebook to Depression\\\" - Forbes\\n\\n\\\"Facebook May Make You Depressed and Jealous\\\" - NPR\\n\\n\\\"Exploring Facebook Depression\\\" - Psychology Today\\n\\n\\\"Science Explains How Facebook Makes You Sad\\\" - Psychology Today\\n\\n\\\"How Facebook Makes Us Unhappy\\\" - The New Yorker\\n\\n\\\"Negative Experiences on Facebook Linked to Increased Depression\\\" - Brown University\\n\\nNote that these are only a few articles listed. There are hundreds more.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI like Facebook and I like Twitter.\\n\\nI like the ability to get updates on my family and friends.\\n\\nI like when it is someone's birthday that I can be reminded to send them birthday wishes, or when my nephews and nieces have parties I can see pictures of them, or if someone needs prayer because of a hard time they are going through, or when there is a new theme park vlog on YouTube, all of these things I like.\\n\\nThere is nothing wrong with using social media use. It is all about balance.\\n\\nSocial media is designed to be addictive. But it is a tool. And like all tools, it can be abused.\\n\\nIf you plan on using social media or a smart phone, or play video games, etc., you need to balance your use of it.\\n\\nToo much time on social media is damaging.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI enjoy a good *conversation*. In the beginning it was possible to have differing opinions on social media, and people did join conversations. But now the trolls have come in and they now decide what can and cannot be talked about anymore. For some reason they have taken over and no longer allow for conversations to occur. \\n\\nThis is the current state of social media:\\n\\\"You are allowed to have an opinion as long as it doesn't differ from mine. And if it is different than mine, then you must be evil and must be destroyed by any means necessary.\\\"\\n\\nThis is the new normal.\\n\\nToo many people are using it to try and silence those that have differing opinions.\\nThey have turned it into a rant box and attention grabber. \\n\\nWe have allowed social media to turn us into greedy, impatient, drama queens & kings.\\n\\nToo many of us that use social media are not using it to advance ourselves or humanity anymore. We are using it to destroy our fellow humans.\\n\\n--- \\n\\nBecause of what has happened, and because of how much destruction that the internet trolls have done and continue to do, people are now simply choosing to keep their mouths shut and go back to being silent. That simply staying out of the way and going back to being voiceless is the smartest way to survive.\\n\\nWe are foolish for thinking that in remaining silent that the problem will simply go away. That somehow the trolls will destroy themselves in their actions. That somehow, people will rise up and come to the realization of what is going on and push the trolls out of social media and that social media will become this wonderful utopia of ideas and open conversation again someday...\\n\\nIf we continue to be silent and allow the drama to continue then it won't.\\n\\nBeing silent makes the situation worse.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe trolls are on the hunt for those with opposing ideas of their own.\\n\\nBy being silent, we are allowing the trolls to turn social media into a massive surveillance state where everything you have ever said will be used against you at some point.\\n\\nNevermind if you made a mistake 5, 10, 20 years ago and you have learned and grown from it. Nevermind if you said something in the past that you've forgotten about that you would want to redact today. The trolls are spinning those past things into anything they want to completely destroy you - because they can.\\n\\nBy staying silent we are allowing the destruction of our fellow humans to continue. You and I are fools by thinking that we can simply stand by the sidelines and stay out of the way and that we will be safe or our families will be safe.\\n\\nThe funny thing is that sooner or later, the silent ones become the targets. We are allowing free speech and democracy to get pushed out by the few who want to take full control of our voices and minds.\\n\\nThis is totalitarianism at it's finest.\\n\\nAnd these trolls' actions are evil.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWe aren't 'using' social media anymore. It is using us. There is no accountability structure in place for posting harsh or damaging things.\\n\\nWe all need to wake up and start looking around at what is actually happening. We can no longer claim plausible deniability. No one is naive about this.\\n \\nIf we intend on keeping social media as a part of our culture and our lives, it's time to re-think how we interact with the tools themselves and it is time to re-evaluate how we interact with others online.\\n\\nReaching someone through an online discussion through bantering and harsh criticism does not help your cause, whatever that may be. Empathy and decency goes a long way when proposing your opinion or idea.\\n\\nWith so much knowledge in the world, there is so little wisdom.\\n\\nWisdom is what people are really looking for. \\n\\nLet us be wise in our interactions online.\\n\\n---\\n\\nOne of my favorite discussions on this topic is by journalist\\nJon Ronson. In his TED talk titled [\\\"How One Tweet Can Ruin Your Life\\\"](https://youtu.be/wAIP6fI0NAI), he finishes with the following statement...\\n\\n> \\\"Twitter is basically a 'mutual approval' machine. We use it to surround ourselves with people that think and feel the same way that we do. But we are now creating a surveillance society where the smartest way to survive is to go back to being voiceless. Let's not do that.\\\" - [Jon Ronson](http://www.jonronson.com)\\n\\nI agree with Jon.\\n\\nIn the beginning, social media platforms brought people together.\\n\\nI believe that, if used wisely, social media networks can still bring people together in a positive way.\\n\\nEmpathy and decency is not all lost.\\n\\nLet's not go silent and let's not allow the idealogs to own our voices.\\n\\n- Joey D\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>&quot;The greatest thing about social media is that it gave a voice to voiceless people...&quot; - Jon Ronson (2016)</p>\n<p>But we aren't 'using' social media anymore.

It is using us.\n\nIn the beginning, social media as a platform was an amazing thing. In the first\ndays of MySpace, Friendster, Twitter, or Facebook (the list goes on) it brought\npeople together. It made it possible to re-connect with family members that\nseemed to have been forgotten. It allowed you to connect with friends or\nco-workers from long ago. And it helped to bring some people together that you\nnever would have thought shared the same values or ideas. This in itself is an\namazing thing!\n\nIn the beginning, social media platforms brought people together.\n\nAnd very quickly, it became the new \"public square\".\n\nSocial media was optimistic, democratic, civil, and it allowed people to be\nsomewhat anonymous. It was considered a \"safe place\" to share your thoughts,\nopinions, disappointments, wins or losses. It was simple and possible to share\nlife experiences and ideas in an assumed safe place  with others that shared the\nsame values as you did.\n\nBut over time something happened.

Also this will be a long post so just skip it if you don't want to read. Finally, I probably won't be commenting or reading any of the comments so please don't expect a response from me here. I'm done with trolling Facebook - it's just too much work to follow-up on everything in social media.\\n\\n--- \\n\\nI don't watch too many movies anymore as I'm very aware now of what types of worldviews and philosophies are being promoted in them. Not sure why this is but I heavily analyze things in movies now. Maybe this is just me getting older...\\n\\nA little while ago I decided to watched the movie \\\"The Founder\\\". It is a biopic of Ray Kroc and the McDonald's brothers and sort of told the story about the rise of the McDonald's restaurant empire and how it came to be. It was really good! I think this is definitely one of Michael Keaton's best performances by far. It is really interesting to see a take on how things might have happened with regards to business dealings and actual events that happened behind the scenes in how the McDonald's Corp came to be.\\n\\nWithout spoiling anything about the plot of the movie, there were a few parts of it that sort of tap into Ray Kroc's marriage and divorce. The actors and actresses do an outstanding job of making you 'feel' the emotions of the scenes and what is going on in the story. This is why I think movies have an effect me more than they used to...\\n\\nOne of the things that I know about myself is that I care deeply about relationships. I also have the gift of discernment - I am able to quite easily place myself into other people's shoes, to feel what they are feeling so to speak. So when there are scenes in movies or TV that deal with divorce or cheating, I don't do well with it and have a very hard time getting past the 'feelings' of the scene. I get upset because it goes against the core of my being.\\n\\nNow, yes I do end up getting past the feeling of course :) I don't stay depressed or anything. But I do reflect on myself. I do think about what I am doing in my life. I think about my family and question myself about how I am maintaining my relationships with Tasha and the kids, and ask myself if I am doing anything wrong, or anything against what I have made promises to.\\n\\nI do recognize that divorce does happen for various reasons. Divorce does happen between some people. And yes, the reasons why divorce can happen may be justified or even sometimes necessary. But my worldview does not support divorce as a *good thing*. \\n\\nI will be very clear. I do not believe that divorce is good.\\n\\nWhy do I believe this?\\n\\nMy reasons as to why I believe that divorce is a bad thing is multi-dimensional as well as complicated. I've been through some very tough times, as have many of my own close family members and friends. I will do my best to attempt to answer why. \\n\\nOne reason is because I am a 'relationship guy'. I care deeply about relationships in general. This is the way my brain is wired and it affects how I interact with people in my life and how I operate in general. I believe in building positive relationships with as many people as I can, building my network of people, helping others succeed, connecting with others on a real level. I use keywords here for a reason - building, connecting, success, commitment, excellence, and the list goes on. Please don't misunderstand when I say this. I am NOT a perfect person at all. I do make mistakes just like everyone else. \\n\\nWe all know what divorce is. Divorce is the severing of relationships. Note that I say \\\"relationships\\\". It is plural. It separates people from each other by force or fiat. The purpose of divorce is to destroy the marriage relationship. It doesn't only sever the two people that are married. It also seperates friendships that may have been built up over the years. Friends typically have to choose a side. Children also have to go through this process of having to bifurcate their father and mother relationships and treat them differently or act differently towards each. Insecurities evolve. Divorce is a distructive act with lasting ripple effects across time.\\n\\nI will go even farther to say this --- All divorces occur due to selfishness. For those that have cheated on their spouses, it is because you made the decision that your own selfishness matters more. For those that verbally or physically abuse your spouses and/or children, you somehow convince yourself that it is OK to do such an act even though you know it was wrong - deception is real. Divorce is always caused by some type of selfishness from at least one person in the marriage relationship which is pathological in nature.\\n\\nDid you know that even with the high divorce rate and it's commonality in today's day and age that divorce is still regarded as a 'negative' thing? I'll say again that yes I do believe it is a very bad thing. With the destruction that divorce causes how can anyone possibly think it is a good thing?\\n\\nWith that being said, for those that are married or dating couples or those that want to marry, I think it is important that we really think about what we are doing in our relationships and really take in the gravity of the situation.\\n\\nHere are a few key things that I hope you think about. Read them all slowly. Read them out loud if you can:\\n- Marriage is a promise, it is a choice, it is a decision.\\n- Marriage is for life.\\n- Marriage is fun! (Yes, it really is!)\\n- Marriage is a gift!\\n\\n**Marriage is designed to make us more self-less and less selfish over time.**\\n\\nI hope you really think about this last one. Over time it becomes less about \\\"me\\\" and more about \\\"us\\\". Marriage, if done correctly, is designed to make us less selfish and more selfless. It is all about 'service', giving, gratefulness...\\n\\n.....\\n\\nI've come up with a list of words that, I think, help to describe what marriage is all about. Seriously think about these words and what they mean to you:\\n\\n- Commitment\\n- Integrity\\n- Dedication\\n- Dependable\\n- Credible\\n- Honor\\n- Trust\\n- Discipline\\n- Intimacy\\n- Sacredness\\n- Service\\n- Responsibility\\n- Accountability\\n- Promises\\n- Best\\n- Hope\\n- Love\\n- Beauty\\n- Thoughtfullness\\n\\nImagine that each word here is written down on a survey about marriage. And next to each word is a check box, then this survey is given to your spouse and they are asked to check every word they feel that you do have. And when they submitted this survey, they were HONEST.\\n\\n** How many check marks would you have? **\\n\\n...\\n\\nI think that for some of you this really hits home.\\n\\nIt does for me. I am not perfect whatsoever. Not even close.\\n\\nI start thinking about some of my own actions lately and some of the things that I've said that there is no way my wife would have placed a check mark for! I know this, and it makes me want to be a better man and not do it again. I care deeply for my wife and children and I don't want to make mistakes.\\n\\nAs a married man I would hope that my wife would check every box on that survey not because I simply want to pass the survey with flying colors, but because that is the person that my wife ACTUALLY views in me!\\n\\n...\\n\\nI have a message for most (not all) married people so I'm going to be very blunt here ---\\n\\n**** We have all been doing a really crappy job at being married. ****\\n\\nThis is not an argument, I'm making a statement.\\n\\nLook around.\\n\\nHow many people do you know that have experienced divorce firsthand? This could be anyone at your workplace, school, or community. It could be a family member, friend, or acquaintence. \\n\\nSeriously. Married people have not been doing a good job of being married.\\n\\nThis is a fact. The statistics don't lie:\\n\\n- In America, there is one divorce approximately every 36 seconds*. That's nearly 2,400 divorces per day, 16,800 divorces per week and 876,000 divorces a year.\\n- The average length of a marriage that ends in divorce is eight years.\\n- People wait an average of three years after a divorce to remarry (if they remarry at all).\\n- The average age for couples going through their first divorce is 30 years old.\\n- 46.9% percent of non-custodial mothers totally default on support (dads getting child support payments), while only 26.9% of non-custodial fathers totally default on support (moms getting child support payments).\\n- 43% of all children growing up in America in the 2010's are being raised without their fathers.\\n- 75% of children with divorced parents live with their mother.\\n- 28% of children living with a divorced parent live in a household with an income below the poverty line.\\n- Half of all American children will witness the breakup of a parent, or grandparent's marriage. Of these children close to half will also see the breakup of a parent or grandparent's second marriage.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nBy our own life experiences,\\n\\nWhen a child has the life experience of being a first-hand witness of their parent's divorce do you know what language is actually being said to them?\\n\\n\\\"This is normal.\\\"\\n\\nActions speak louder than words. \\n\\nIn fact, all actions are a spoken language. **All** actions.\\n\\nWhen a person shows up to work *on time*, every single day, it tells the leadership team that that employee *wants* to be there. \\nWhen a person shows up to work on time every day it tells the leadership team that the employee is fully committed to the job.\\nIt tells the leadership team that the employee is responsible.\\nIt may even tell the leadership team that the employee enjoys their work.\\n\\nWhen a friend give you a call and asks you for your help, and you show up to help them as asked at the time they were expecting you to arrive, it *tells* them that you truly care for them. It tells them that you want to be their friend, and for you to be their friend in kind.\\n\\nWhen I come home from a long day of work, and my children scream \\\"Daddy's home!\\\" then they run up to me and give me great big bear hugs, it tells me that my children trust me. It tells me that they are happy that I am home! It tells me that I just might be doing a good job being a good dad to them!\\n\\nYou don't need to speak in order to tell someone something. \\n\\nActions always speak louder than the spoken word.\\n\\nWhen two people stand in front of a crowd, profess their love to each other, and make a promise to commit to each other in all things, to promise to be there for each other in the good times and the bad times, to promise to be there for each other *no matter what* until the end of their lives, promise to be faithful to each other, it is telling everyone listening that \\\"I am taking responsibility for this relationship and I will not break this promise no matter what. This is mine and I will never let it go. I will do whatever it takes to keep that promise.\\\" This is what is actually being said when two people get married.\\n\\nBy our actions we are showing the world, and we are showing our children, what marriage is all about. \\n\\nWhen a couple divorces we are saying \\\"divorce is normal\\\". In fact we are teaching and telling the world that marriage doesn't even matter anymore. We are saying that marriage is an old idea that has no merit in this modern day and marriage doesn't matter.\\n\\nEveryone has heard the saying, \\\"promises are made to be broken\\\". Well with divorce we are saying that \\\"marriages are meant to be ended\\\". \\n\\nWhen we divorce, we are teaching our children that this is 'normal', that divorce is 'ok' and that divorce is standard human behavior.\\n\\n.....\\n\\n(This section may be hard for some people I know, sorry ahead of time...)\\n\\nSome of us have gone through the process of our parents divorcing. And some of us might be going through it right now.\\n\\nBut do you know what?\\n\\nDivorce really screws us up.\\n\\nIt screws up our kids.\\n\\nMy own parents divorced after about 23 years of marriage. I was 22 years old when it happened and I had just started dating my wife when it was announced that my parents were splitting up.\\n\\nWhen they started the divorce process, do you know what happened?\\n\\nInsecurity about all aspects of LIFE began to take hold in my mind. Questions like this came up all the time:\\n\\n- What is going to happen to me?\\n- What is going to happen to my parents?\\n- Is this what will happen with me when I get married?\\n- Is this what will happen to my siblings when they get married?\\n- Should I even bother getting married at all?\\n\\nYeah, this actually happened to me. There are some times when this same insecurity comes up in my mind and I have to really work it out. I know this happens to all children regardless of age in a divorce.\\n\\nHere is another thing that happened to me...\\nI don't normally talk about this but I will here since I'm on topic ---\\n\\nI don't ever talk to my father or my mother about marriage and I never ask them for any type of marriage advice.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nBecause trust and credibility are good friends. When you lose one you typically lose the other at the same time.\\n\\nWhen you lose someone's trust or credibility, it takes a very long time to gain it back. Now, this is only true and unique with my own parents. I'm not saying that I don't trust my parents at all, and I'm not trying to chastise them! Both are happily re-married and both probably have very good advice to give.\\n\\nI'm only trying to make a point.

I hope it does, because this stuff matters.\\n\\nThe point I'm trying to make is that while it still happens, and while it still may be a necessary step for certain situations, divorce in itself is not a good \\\"thing\\\".\\n\\nSo for those that are married, or want to get married, really think about how you are 'doing' marriage.\\n\\nDo everything you can to set up your own marriage for success.\\n\\nThink about these questions:\\n\\n- Do I appreciate my spouse?\\n- Do I show them my appreciation?\\n- What are some of the things that I can do for my spouse that make them feel loved by me? (Ask them this question, their answer might surprise you!)\\n- Am I lying to them about anything?\\n- What is at least one thing that I am grateful for in my spouse?\\n\\nThere are many more questions that apply here. But just remember that marriage is not about \\\"me\\\" or \\\"you\\\". It is about \\\"us\\\". And it is important that all married people adpot responsibility for our actions and correct our own ways.\\n\\nIt is important that we make the correct decisions in our personal and professional lives. This means that we actually do need to know what is 'right' and what is 'wrong'.\\n\\nWe do need a kick in the rear every once in a while, and steer ourselves back on the right track.\\n\\nTake your relationships seriously.

Not sure why this is but I heavily analyze things in movies now. Maybe this is just me getting older...</p>\n<p>A little while ago I decided to watched the movie &quot;The Founder&quot;. It is a biopic of Ray Kroc and the McDonald's brothers and sort of told the story about the rise of the McDonald's restaurant empire and how it came to be. It was really good! I think this is definitely one of Michael Keaton's best performances by far. It is really interesting to see a take on how things might have happened with regards to business dealings and actual events that happened behind the scenes in how the McDonald's Corp came to be.</p>\n<p>Without spoiling anything about the plot of the movie, there were a few parts of it that sort of tap into Ray Kroc's marriage and divorce. The actors and actresses do an outstanding job of making you 'feel' the emotions of the scenes and what is going on in the story. This is why I think movies have an effect me more than they used to...</p>\n<p>One of the things that I know about myself is that I care deeply about relationships. I also have the gift of discernment - I am able to quite easily place myself into other people's shoes, to feel what they are feeling so to speak. So when there are scenes in movies or TV that deal with divorce or cheating, I don't do well with it and have a very hard time getting past the 'feelings' of the scene. I get upset because it goes against the core of my being.</p>\n<p>Now, yes I do end up getting past the feeling of course :) I don't stay depressed or anything. But I do reflect on myself. I do think about what I am doing in my life. I think about my family and question myself about how I am maintaining my relationships with Tasha and the kids, and ask myself if I am doing anything wrong, or anything against what I have made promises to.</p>\n<p>I do recognize that divorce does happen for various reasons. Divorce does happen between some people. And yes, the reasons why divorce can happen may be justified or even sometimes necessary. But my worldview does not support divorce as a <em>good thing</em>.</p>\n<p>I will be very clear. I do not believe that divorce is good.</p>\n<p>Why do I believe this?</p>\n<p>My reasons as to why I believe that divorce is a bad thing is multi-dimensional as well as complicated. I've been through some very tough times, as have many of my own close family members and friends. I will do my best to attempt to answer why.</p>\n<p>One reason is because I am a 'relationship guy'. I care deeply about relationships in general. This is the way my brain is wired and it affects how I interact with people in my life and how I operate in general. I believe in building positive relationships with as many people as I can, building my network of people, helping others succeed, connecting with others on a real level. I use keywords here for a reason - building, connecting, success, commitment, excellence, and the list goes on. Please don't misunderstand when I say this. I am NOT a perfect person at all. I do make mistakes just like everyone else.</p>\n<p>We all know what divorce is. Divorce is the severing of relationships. Note that I say &quot;relationships&quot;. It is plural. It separates people from each other by force or fiat. The purpose of divorce is to destroy the marriage relationship. It doesn't only sever the two people that are married. It also seperates friendships that may have been built up over the years. Friends typically have to choose a side. Children also have to go through this process of having to bifurcate their father and mother relationships and treat them differently or act differently towards each. Insecurities evolve. Divorce is a distructive act with lasting ripple effects across time.</p>\n<p>I will go even farther to say this --- All divorces occur due to selfishness. For those that have cheated on their spouses, it is because you made the decision that your own selfishness matters more. For those that verbally or physically abuse your spouses and/or children, you somehow convince yourself that it is OK to do such an act even though you know it was wrong - deception is real. Divorce is always caused by some type of selfishness from at least one person in the marriage relationship which is pathological in nature.</p>\n<p>Did you know that even with the high divorce rate and it's commonality in today's day and age that divorce is still regarded as a 'negative' thing? I'll say again that yes I do believe it is a very bad thing. With the destruction that divorce causes how can anyone possibly think it is a good thing?</p>\n<p>With that being said, for those that are married or dating couples or those that want to marry, I think it is important that we really think about what we are doing in our relationships and really take in the gravity of the situation.</p>\n<p>Here are a few key things that I hope you think about. Read them all slowly. Read them out loud if you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marriage is a promise, it is a choice, it is a decision.</li>\n<li>Marriage is for life.</li>\n<li>Marriage is fun! (Yes, it really is!)</li>\n<li>Marriage is a gift!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Marriage is designed to make us more self-less and less selfish over time.</strong></p>\n<p>I hope you really think about this last one. Over time it becomes less about &quot;me&quot; and more about &quot;us&quot;. Marriage, if done correctly, is designed to make us less selfish and more selfless. It is all about 'service', giving, gratefulness...</p>\n<p>.....</p>\n<p>I've come up with a list of words that, I think, help to describe what marriage is all about. Seriously think about these words and what they mean to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Commitment</li>\n<li>Integrity</li>\n<li>Dedication</li>\n<li>Dependable</li>\n<li>Credible</li>\n<li>Honor</li>\n<li>Trust</li>\n<li>Discipline</li>\n<li>Intimacy</li>\n<li>Sacredness</li>\n<li>Service</li>\n<li>Responsibility</li>\n<li>Accountability</li>\n<li>Promises</li>\n<li>Best</li>\n<li>Hope</li>\n<li>Love</li>\n<li>Beauty</li>\n<li>Thoughtfullness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Imagine that each word here is written down on a survey about marriage. And next to each word is a check box, then this survey is given to your spouse and they are asked to check every word they feel that you do have. And when they submitted this survey, they were HONEST.</p>\n<p>** How many check marks would you have? **</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>I think that for some of you this really hits home.</p>\n<p>It does for me. I am not perfect whatsoever. Not even close.</p>\n<p>I start thinking about some of my own actions lately and some of the things that I've said that there is no way my wife would have placed a check mark for! I know this, and it makes me want to be a better man and not do it again. I care deeply for my wife and children and I don't want to make mistakes.</p>\n<p>As a married man I would hope that my wife would check every box on that survey not because I simply want to pass the survey with flying colors, but because that is the person that my wife ACTUALLY views in me!</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>I have a message for most (not all) married people so I'm going to be very blunt here ---</p>\n<p>**** We have all been doing a really crappy job at being married. ****</p>\n<p>This is not an argument, I'm making a statement.</p>\n<p>Look around.</p>\n<p>How many people do you know that have experienced divorce firsthand? This could be anyone at your workplace, school, or community. It could be a family member, friend, or acquaintence.</p>\n<p>Seriously. Married people have not been doing a good job of being married.</p>\n<p>This is a fact. The statistics don't lie:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In America, there is one divorce approximately every 36 seconds*. That's nearly 2,400 divorces per day, 16,800 divorces per week and 876,000 divorces a year.</li>\n<li>The average length of a marriage that ends in divorce is eight years.</li>\n<li>People wait an average of three years after a divorce to remarry (if they remarry at all).</li>\n<li>The average age for couples going through their first divorce is 30 years old.</li>\n<li>46.9% percent of non-custodial mothers totally default on support (dads getting child support payments), while only 26.9% of non-custodial fathers totally default on support (moms getting child support payments).</li>\n<li>43% of all children growing up in America in the 2010's are being raised without their fathers.</li>\n<li>75% of children with divorced parents live with their mother.</li>\n<li>28% of children living with a divorced parent live in a household with an income below the poverty line.</li>\n<li>Half of all American children will witness the breakup of a parent, or grandparent's marriage. Of these children close to half will also see the breakup of a parent or grandparent's second marriage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>.....</p>\n<p>By our own life experiences,</p>\n<p>When a child has the life experience of being a first-hand witness of their parent's divorce do you know what language is actually being said to them?</p>\n<p>&quot;This is normal.&quot;</p>\n<p>Actions speak louder than words.</p>\n<p>In fact, all actions are a spoken language. <strong>All</strong> actions.</p>\n<p>When a person shows up to work <em>on time</em>, every single day, it tells the leadership team that that employee <em>wants</em> to be there.<br>\nWhen a person shows up to work on time every day it tells the leadership team that the employee is fully committed to the job.<br>\nIt tells the leadership team that the employee is responsible.<br>\nIt may even tell the leadership team that the employee enjoys their work.</p>\n<p>When a friend give you a call and asks you for your help, and you show up to help them as asked at the time they were expecting you to arrive, it <em>tells</em> them that you truly care for them. It tells them that you want to be their friend, and for you to be their friend in kind.</p>\n<p>When I come home from a long day of work, and my children scream &quot;Daddy's home!&quot; then they run up to me and give me great big bear hugs, it tells me that my children trust me. It tells me that they are happy that I am home! It tells me that I just might be doing a good job being a good dad to them!</p>\n<p>You don't need to speak in order to tell someone something.</p>\n<p>Actions always speak louder than the spoken word.</p>\n<p>When two people stand in front of a crowd, profess their love to each other, and make a promise to commit to each other in all things, to promise to be there for each other in the good times and the bad times, to promise to be there for each other <em>no matter what</em> until the end of their lives, promise to be faithful to each other, it is telling everyone listening that &quot;I am taking responsibility for this relationship and I will not break this promise no matter what. This is mine and I will never let it go. I will do whatever it takes to keep that promise.&quot; This is what is actually being said when two people get married.</p>\n<p>By our actions we are showing the world, and we are showing our children, what marriage is all about.</p>\n<p>When a couple divorces we are saying &quot;divorce is normal&quot;. In fact we are teaching and telling the world that marriage doesn't even matter anymore. We are saying that marriage is an old idea that has no merit in this modern day and marriage doesn't matter.</p>\n<p>Everyone has heard the saying, &quot;promises are made to be broken&quot;. Well with divorce we are saying that &quot;marriages are meant to be ended&quot;.</p>\n<p>When we divorce, we are teaching our children that this is 'normal', that divorce is 'ok' and that divorce is standard human behavior.</p>\n<p>.....</p>\n<p>(This section may be hard for some people I know, sorry ahead of time...)</p>\n<p>Some of us have gone through the process of our parents divorcing. And some of us might be going through it right now.</p>\n<p>But do you know what?</p>\n<p>Divorce really screws us up.</p>\n<p>It screws up our kids.</p>\n<p>My own parents divorced after about 23 years of marriage. I was 22 years old when it happened and I had just started dating my wife when it was announced that my parents were splitting up.</p>\n<p>When they started the divorce process, do you know what happened?</p>\n<p>Insecurity about all aspects of LIFE began to take hold in my mind. Questions like this came up all the time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is going to happen to me?</li>\n<li>What is going to happen to my parents?</li>\n<li>Is this what will happen with me when I get married?</li>\n<li>Is this what will happen to my siblings when they get married?</li>\n<li>Should I even bother getting married at all?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yeah, this actually happened to me. There are some times when this same insecurity comes up in my mind and I have to really work it out. I know this happens to all children regardless of age in a divorce.</p>\n<p>Here is another thing that happened to me...<br>\nI don't normally talk about this but I will here since I'm on topic ---</p>\n<p>I don't ever talk to my father or my mother about marriage and I never ask them for any type of marriage advice.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>Because trust and credibility are good friends. When you lose one you typically lose the other at the same time.</p>\n<p>When you lose someone's trust or credibility, it takes a very long time to gain it back.

It tells me\nthat I just might be doing a good job being a good dad to them!\n\nYou don't need to speak in order to tell someone something.\n\nActions always speak louder than the spoken word.\n\nWhen two people stand in front of a crowd, profess their love to each other, and\nmake a promise to commit to each other in all things, to promise to be there for\neach other in the good times and the bad times, to promise to be there for each\nother no matter what  until the end of their lives, promise to be faithful to\neach other, it is telling everyone listening that \"I am taking responsibility\nfor this relationship and I will not break this promise no matter what. This is\nmine and I will never let it go. I will do whatever it takes to keep that\npromise.\" This is what is actually being said when two people get married.\n\nBy our actions we are showing the world, and we are showing our children, what\nmarriage is all about.\n\nWhen a couple divorces we are saying \"divorce is normal\". In fact we are\nteaching and telling the world that marriage doesn't even matter anymore. We are\nsaying that marriage is an old idea that has no merit in this modern day and\nmarriage doesn't matter.\n\nEveryone has heard the saying, \"promises are made to be broken\". Well with\ndivorce we are saying that \"marriages are meant to be ended\".\n\nWhen we divorce, we are teaching our children that this is 'normal', that\ndivorce is 'ok' and that divorce is standard human behavior.\n\n.....\n\n(This section may be hard for some people I know, sorry ahead of time...)\n\nSome of us have gone through the process of our parents divorcing. And some of\nus might be going through it right now.\n\nBut do you know what?\n\nDivorce really screws us up.\n\nIt screws up our kids.\n\nMy own parents divorced after about 23 years of marriage. I was 22 years old\nwhen it happened and I had just started dating my wife when it was announced\nthat my parents were splitting up.\n\nWhen they started the divorce process, do you know what happened?\n\nInsecurity about all aspects of LIFE began to take hold in my mind. Questions\nlike this came up all the time:\n\n * What is going to happen to me?\n * What is going to happen to my parents?\n * Is this what will happen with me when I get married?\n * Is this what will happen to my siblings when they get married?\n * Should I even bother getting married at all?\n\nYeah, this actually happened to me. There are some times when this same\ninsecurity comes up in my mind and I have to really work it out. I know this\nhappens to all children regardless of age in a divorce.\n\nHere is another thing that happened to me...\nI don't normally talk about this but I will here since I'm on topic ---\n\nI don't ever talk to my father or my mother about marriage and I never ask them\nfor any type of marriage advice.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause trust and credibility are good friends. When you lose one you typically\nlose the other at the same time.\n\nWhen you lose someone's trust or credibility, it takes a very long time to gain\nit back. Now, this is only true and unique with my own parents. I'm not saying\nthat I don't trust my parents at all, and I'm not trying to chastise them! Both\nare happily re-married and both probably have very good advice to give.\n\nI'm only trying to make a point. You wouldn't get medical advice from someone\nthat had their medical license revoked and you wouldn't take financial advice\nfrom someone that went to prison for fraud. What I'm saying is that it is very\ndifficult to ask my parents for marriage advice should I need it.\n\n.....\n\nDoes this bother you? I hope it does, because this stuff matters.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that while it still happens, and while it still\nmay be a necessary step for certain situations, divorce in itself is not a good\n\"thing\".\n\nSo for those that are married, or want to get married, really think about how\nyou are 'doing' marriage.\n\nDo everything you can to set up your own marriage for success.\n\nThink about these questions:\n\n * Do I appreciate my spouse?\n * Do I show them my appreciation?\n * What are some of the things that I can do for my spouse that make them feel\n   loved by me? (Ask them this question, their answer might surprise you!)\n * Am I lying to them about anything?\n * What is at least one thing that I am grateful for in my spouse?\n\nThere are many more questions that apply here. But just remember that marriage\nis not about \"me\" or \"you\". It is about \"us\". And it is important that all\nmarried people adpot responsibility for our actions and correct our own ways.\n\nIt is important that we make the correct decisions in our personal and\nprofessional lives. This means that we actually do need to know what is 'right'\nand what is 'wrong'.\n\nWe do need a kick in the rear every once in a while, and steer ourselves back on\nthe right track.\n\nTake your relationships seriously. Because believe it or not, they actually\nmatter not only to you but to your peers and your children.\n\nMake every day in your marriage count.\n\nBe a better person today than you were yesterday.\n\nApply good, positive, principles in your lives.\n\nSet goals and seriously think about them every day.\n\nSet goals at work.\n\nSet goals in your marriage and talk about them with your spouse.\n\nSet up your life so that you and your spouse reach those goals together.\n\nAdpot the concepts of \"teamwork\" and \"alignment\" in your marriage.\n\nBelieve in your spouse.\n\nServe them, love them as you love yourself.\n\nTake responsibility for your actions and be highly aware of them.\n\nTeach your children.\n\nLove, honor, and build trust in your spouse and your children.\n\nKnow what it means to be grateful.\n\nBe grateful.\n\n * Joey D","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-02-20T04:59:02.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2019-04-05T03:12:22.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":null,"published_by":null,"custom_excerpt":"Some good hard truths about marriage, why it is good, what it means, and why it should be taken seriously.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdccd0","uuid":"bef1632f-8fbd-4dc2-835f-90b26547e32b","title":"Being Average","slug":"being-average-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":null,"comment_id":"5a8e3736db47902a9ea75c70","plaintext":null,"feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-02-22T03:21:26.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-02-22T03:21:26.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":null,"published_by":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5ca807620c04bb1452bdccd1","uuid":"85b3421f-68b8-46dd-9f77-c817eb3ab437","title":"The Disney Theme Park Facade","slug":"disney-theme-parks-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"I fail to understand why people are legitimately excited for Star Wars Galaxy's Edge or even the new super hero lands (*see note) and attractions, at Disney's theme parks.\\n\\nI want to think about this for a bit, starting with theme park pricing.\\n\\nDisney has successfully priced out most families from their theme parks a very long time ago. Specifically they are not interested in you or me paying hard earned money to visit their parks for one or two days, purchase a meal or two every day, maybe get a souvenir, and ride a few rides in the normal queue lines.

Then assume $200 per day for food and maybe another $200 for merchandise for the trip. Avg $800+400+200 = $1400. Then let's say they visit twice a year, the average income earned from this type of visitor still hangs around $3000 per year --- half the earnings of a vacation package group.

However the way this question is posed assumes there is a serious gender-based bias regarding wages in the west. I know that there must still be some employers in the west that continue to discriminate against women or those that are gay by suppressing their earning wages. However I myself am a skeptic in the claim that in this day and age this is a widespread issue. But we can debate this another time.\\n\\nWhat we do know is that yes; it is true that women, *as a group*, do get paid less than *men as a group*. The claim that women \\\"make around 79 cents for every dollar earned by men\\\" is a widespread belief. But when making this statement we are leaving out all of the complicated factors about how wages are determined, as well as what people are willing to accept for their own wages. Plus, this claim does not represent all women in all areas. For example, almost all of my managers and directors in every place I've worked have mostly been women and all had significantly higher wages than myself. Are these edge cases? I think not. Also, when making this claim they are leaving out the fact that this specific gap has been rapidly closing over a very short period of time and continues to do so as more and more women join the workforce and more and more women take even higher paying jobs in both blue and white collar positions.\\n\\nThe fact of the matter is that determining individual wages a very complex issue with no quick or simple answer. Virtually all employees are paid differently for a variety of reasons. Some reasons of which are valid, and others which may not be valid. But nonetheless people are paid differently.\\n\\nLet us ask the question in a different manner...\\n\\n*Should two people, with the same title, the same job description, same boss, and same responsibilities be paid exactly the same?*\\n\\nSaying \\\"yes\\\" is the wrong answer. But so is saying \\\"no\\\" because as it turns out the true answer is not that simple. The answer is more complex than you think. The correct answer could be, \\\"It depends\\\" or even \\\"I don't know\\\".\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nThe answer is because of a wide array of factors that goes into how much salary a person earns. It is part of a multi-factored analysis that must be taken into account and cannot be left out. For example, many questions need to be answered such as:\\n\\n* How much experience does the person have?\\n* How long have they been in their current position?\\n* Do they show leadership potential?\\n* Have they consistently been doing the job correctly?\\n* Do they have the proper training and skills?\\n* Do they show up on time and leave at an appropriate time every work day, consistently?\\n* Does the person even display that they want to work there?\\n* Is this employee considered reliable and dependable?\\n* Are we paying the individual comprable market rates for their labor?\\n\\nThose are questions about an individual person. Next, you now have to focus on questions on the business and its leadership itself...\\n\\n* Is the leadership corrupt? Or do they actually display integrity? How do they do this?\\n* Are there checks and balances in their hiring and firing practices?\\n* Is the business consistently working to train and improve their personnel and business practices? \\n* Have they consistently shown that they care about their employees? How have they done this?\\n* And many more...\\n\\n*Note that these questions don't ask anything about a person's worldview, gender, or personal identity because those things do not, and should not, matter when determining wages.*\\n\\nSo let's assume that we have asked these questions and we have some answers to them. Now, how do you properly match and weigh these answers to help determine a person's salary? Not every business has the exact same policies and procedures regarding salary rules. Where do you even begin?\\n\\nI honestly have absolutely no idea. I suppose for myself, I rely on the market to help determine my own wages so I do assume this is how businesses pay wages as well.\\n\\nOn a similar note, I believe that wages is something that trade and labor unions have attempted to try to help with because of historical corruption from business leadership in the past. Most unions enforce blanket wages policy across the board, with some wages based on \\\"levels\\\" or years of service and so forth. I must confess, I am not well versed in the pros and cons of labor unions. However from an outsider's perspective it appears that *most* unions nowadays are simply corrupt themselves and have made the wages situation worse over time. However that is another topic for another day...\\n\\n---\\n\\nI am one of the kind of people that does not care how much money another person makes, even if that person has the same title or job role as me. I simply have the expectation that my superiors are paid more than myself.\\n\\nI simply just don't care about anybody else's salary other than my own because I really can control how much I want to earn in my life through hard work, education, and the market. I have found that it is wise to only focus on the things that I can control myself instead of focusing on everybody else's problems. If I really felt like I was being taken advantage of, that I was lowballed in my salary, then I would freely leave and find something else.\\n\\nIn today's western society we operate under the basic rules of a free market economic system called capitalism. It has been like this for a very long time. And a part of the rules of capitalism has to do with salary. Everyone that I work with at my current job does make a different salary than me. Some are paid more, some are paid less. Some are women and some are men. And the reason why people are paid differently is because of experience or title or years of service or other similar factors.\\n\\nIn free market systems like capitalism there are concepts like goods, services, and labor. When I go to work, that is me selling my labor. My labor has a cost. If the business is not willing to pay for my labor then I take it somewhere else. It is their loss. Sometimes my labor gets more expensive. And if the business values that labor they will pay for it. Concepts of value vary widely as well, such as the law of supply and demand. I could go on and on but you get the point.\\n\\nCapitalism in the west has thrived for centuries thanks to markets. The markets dictate who will succeed and who will not succeed. And markets thrive the best in capitalist societies. **Capitalism, when done correctly, does not have built-in gender-bias.**\\n\\nSo if a business is corrupt by purposely underpaying women, and if the markets disapprove of this (which our society does disapprove of including myself personally), then people will take their money elsewhere and will not support that specific market - in effect causing that business (or even that market itself) to fail and crumble.\\n\\n**Markets are somewhat equivalent to freedom.**\\n\\nTo those who think that markets are/were built by the white male patriarchy, or that women have no power in markets, consider this:\\n\\n* Women account for more than 85% of all consumer purchasing decisions in the world. It has been like this for decades. \\n* In short, WOMEN control, and have controlled, how almost all money is spent worldwide!\\n* More than 50% of all marketing department employees in almost ALL businesses are women.\\n* Women dominate market decisions as well as marketing decisions.\\n\\nHow did this come to be? Has it always been this way? Perhaps. But does this mean that men are actively trying to oppress themselves and remove themselves from making market decisions? I don't think so. And does this even matter? Who cares if women have all of the purchasing power! It doesn't matter. Because men still get what they want and women still get what they want. It is a non-issue.\\n\\nSo for those that want to destroy markets, you effectively remove 'choice'. All you have left is 'central planning' where very few are making all of the decisions for the majority. And by the way, *big government means central planning*. It is the same thing. The Soviet Union, Germany, Vietnam, Cuba, and many more all tried to implement central planning. And all tried within the 20th century. Read history and see what happened as a result. Believe me that is a road that we do not want to go down...\\n\\nIf for some reason a great deal of the society is unhappy with how we're using capitalism today, and there is a great want to replace capitalism with something else, then I am open to having an honest and candid conversation about it. But what I am not willing to do is to just blindly accept whatever the popular alternative of the day is. I am not willing to destroy what is currently in place without having some type of alternative ready to go. And I am not willing to accept an alternative without seriously talking about the pros and cons. I want to make an intellectual decision. I want to be as correct as possible. Because if there is one thing that humans including myself have proven time and time again, is that we are NOT perfect and are prone to making very large and very quick mistakes with dire consequences.\\n\\nI think that our current economic system supports our individualistic ideals and allows us the thrive in a positive way. I do believe that yes, we can always do better too. There are always areas to improve and we should talk about these things without treating others with different ideas as less than human.\\n\\n---\\n\\nGender should not play a role in determining wages at all. But don't focus on this question because it is the wrong one to ask. Instead, try to think about the complexity of how wages are determined for individual people.\\n\\nEither we value individual contribution and pay the wages of the individual properly, or we don't.

Capitalism, when done correctly, does not have built-in\ngender-bias.\n\nSo if a business is corrupt by purposely underpaying women, and if the markets\ndisapprove of this (which our society does disapprove of including myself\npersonally), then people will take their money elsewhere and will not support\nthat specific market - in effect causing that business (or even that market\nitself) to fail and crumble.\n\nMarkets are somewhat equivalent to freedom.\n\nTo those who think that markets are/were built by the white male patriarchy, or\nthat women have no power in markets, consider this:\n\n * Women account for more than 85% of all consumer purchasing decisions in the\n   world. It has been like this for decades.\n * In short, WOMEN control, and have controlled, how almost all money is spent\n   worldwide!\n * More than 50% of all marketing department employees in almost ALL businesses\n   are women.\n * Women dominate market decisions as well as marketing decisions.\n\nHow did this come to be? Has it always been this way? Perhaps. But does this\nmean that men are actively trying to oppress themselves and remove themselves\nfrom making market decisions? I don't think so. And does this even matter? Who\ncares if women have all of the purchasing power! It doesn't matter. Because men\nstill get what they want and women still get what they want. It is a non-issue.\n\nSo for those that want to destroy markets, you effectively remove 'choice'. All\nyou have left is 'central planning' where very few are making all of the\ndecisions for the majority. And by the way, big government means central\nplanning. It is the same thing. The Soviet Union, Germany, Vietnam, Cuba, and\nmany more all tried to implement central planning. And all tried within the 20th\ncentury. Read history and see what happened as a result. Believe me that is a\nroad that we do not want to go down...\n\nIf for some reason a great deal of the society is unhappy with how we're using\ncapitalism today, and there is a great want to replace capitalism with something\nelse, then I am open to having an honest and candid conversation about it. But\nwhat I am not willing to do is to just blindly accept whatever the popular\nalternative of the day is. I am not willing to destroy what is currently in\nplace without having some type of alternative ready to go. And I am not willing\nto accept an alternative without seriously talking about the pros and cons. I\nwant to make an intellectual decision. I want to be as correct as possible.\nBecause if there is one thing that humans including myself have proven time and\ntime again, is that we are NOT perfect and are prone to making very large and\nvery quick mistakes with dire consequences.\n\nI think that our current economic system supports our individualistic ideals and\nallows us the thrive in a positive way. I do believe that yes, we can always do\nbetter too. There are always areas to improve and we should talk about these\nthings without treating others with different ideas as less than human.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGender should not play a role in determining wages at all. But don't focus on\nthis question because it is the wrong one to ask. Instead, try to think about\nthe complexity of how wages are determined for individual people.\n\nEither we value individual contribution and pay the wages of the individual\nproperly, or we don't. And if we choose not to, then God help us all...\n\n * Joey D","feature_image":"/content/images/2018/04/02-04_wages.jpeg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-04-30T01:30:05.000Z","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2018-10-01T02:24:38.000Z","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2018-10-01T02:24:38.000Z","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":"Should men and women be paid equally?
